Mikel Arteta knows Arsenal must make a flawless finish to the season after a 2-0 win against Wolves gave them renewed hope of qualifying for the Champions League. Arteta’s side made it three successive league victories thanks to Bukayo Saka’s first half strike and a late Alexandre Lacazette goal at Molineux. Arsenal are now six points behind fourth placed Manchester United with five games left. Fifth-place Chelsea were playing later and could move two points ahead of United. The Gunners remain a long shot to reach next season’s Champions League, but if second placed Manchester City’s continental ban is upheld, a fifth place finish would secure a place in Europe’s elite club competition. “Every game you have no margin for error, we know that we try to win every game,” Arteta said. “Let’s enjoy it a little bit before we start thinking about Leicester and try to go again. We try to improve as a team. “It’s probably one of the best wins because of the difficult schedule we’ve had and how well they have been doing all season. “Winning is not an easy thing to do and it’s another step forward in our process and I’m really happy.”
