Gov. Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State says the Infectious Diseases Control Centre in Lafia is ready for use.  The governor made the disclosure on Friday while inspecting the centre. He explained that the project was started by the immediate past administration in the state and completed by his administration. He said “we have completed the project and the surrounding work, including landscaping, planting of flowers, except the construction of the road leading to the centre.” Sule also said that the centre would soon be inaugurated to begin operations. He noted that the state government was partnering with many organisations, including the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to put the centre to use for the benefit of the public. Sule added that NCDC had promised to establish a molecular laboratory for infectious diseases including coronavirus, lassa fever, Ebola among others. The governor also said that the centre would serve as a research centre. He, therefore, commended all the partners who contributed in one way or the other for the success of the project.
