Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Wednesday, fixed Oct. 20 for continuation of trial of the immediate-past Head of Service (HoS) of the Federation, Winifred Oyo-Ita.  Justice Taiwo adjourned the trial on the grounds that he was not properly briefed about the latest scheduled date. According to him, I am not aware that the matter will be coming up today and since the matter is not time, it is better to adjourn it for another date. “Besides, the recorder is not here and I believe that we should all keep safe.
