The capital market community has supported the Kano State Government’s fight against Covid-19 with the donation of a brand new fully equipped ambulance. Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje who received the donation, described it as timely and commended the capital Market community for the kind gesture. According to him, “This is a good time for the donation as the State is currently embarking on community sample collection aimed at getting more people tested for corona virus”. The Governor, while inspecting the vehicle’s sophisticated facilities, promised that the State Task Force Against COVID-19 will make judicious use of the vehicle. In his remarks earlier, the Commission’s Zonal Director in Kano, Danladi Mohammad who presented the ambulance to the Governor on behalf of the Capital Market Support Committee on COVID-19 CMSCC, noted that the gesture was to complement efforts of the State government in the war against the pandemic, which he said is being won already. He expressed appreciation over the steps taken by the State govt, and prayed to Allah to bring an end to the pandemic. The CMSCC was set up on Thursday, April 16, 2020, to coordinate the capital market community’s contribution to fighting Covid-19 and has Mr. Ariyo Olushekun as Chairman. The Committee has been working tirelessly to mobilize resources from market participants and other stakeholders to advance the cause of providing palliatives to those in need and medical equipments to designated hospitals and isolation centres.
