Watford and Bournemouth were on Sunday relegated from the Premier League on the final day of the season. Watford’s 3-2 defeat at Arsenal condemned them to 19th place, while third bottom Bournemouth’s 3-1 win at Everton wasn’t enough to save them. Aston Villa’s 1-1 draw at West Ham ensured they stayed up at Bournemouth’s expense as Dean Smith’s fourth bottom side finished one point above the Cherries and Watford. Meanwhile, Aston Villa sat just a point clear as they drew West Ham 0-0, knowing that defeat coupled with victory for Bournemouth would send them down to the Championship for the first time just one year after regaining their Premier League status via the play-offs. In a late flurry of goals, Jack Grealish appeared to have secured Villa’s safety by opening the scoring, only to see Andriy Yarmolenko equalise minutes later for the Hammers and keep the visitors’ nerves on edge, while Junior Stanislas put Bournemouth’s victory beyond doubt by scoring their third of the afternoon.
