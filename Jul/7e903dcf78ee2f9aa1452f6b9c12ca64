He stressed that passengers must always wear their face masks before entering the airport terminal and on board, and are expected to submit themselves for temperature checks before boarding. According to him: “If your temperature reads above 37 degrees, you’ll be denied boarding. No loitering on the aisle of the aircraft.

Flying will be somewhat different but we can guarantee your safety.’’ Olisa who implored the flying public to download the Air Peace Mobile App for seamless booking and check-in, asserted that all the airline’s aircraft are in perfect shape as multiple shakedown flights have been conducted for safety reassurance. He added that the airline has also been operating series of ‘special’ flights, which is an indication of aircraft airworthiness.
