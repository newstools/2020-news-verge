Gov. Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, has felicitated with the Muslim faithful in the state and across the world, on the occasion of the Eid-el-Kabir celebration.  Makinde, in a Sallah message on Thursday in Ibadan by Mr Taiwo Adisa, his Chief Press Secretary, admonished Muslims to adhere to the teachings of love, sacrifice and perseverance, which the festival epitomised. He said the “Festival of Sacrifice” known as Eid-el-Kabir, presented an opportunity for Muslims to reflect on the faith with which Prophet Ibrahim willingly agreed to sacrifice his son, in obedience to the command of the Almighty Allah. The governor said that the all-important Eid Adha was worth celebrating despite the restrictions brought upon the world by the COVID-19 pandemic. He encouraged every Muslim to use the opportunity to pray for the peace in the world and to show love and selflessness, in line with the examples shown by Prophet Ibrahim. Makinde further urged all Muslims in the state, especially the clerics and leaders, to ensure strict compliance with the COVID-19 protocols. He said: “I congratulate the Muslim Ummah in Oyo State and across the world on the opportunity given to us by Allah SWT to witness the 2020 Eid-el-Kabir. “Despite the restrictions brought upon the world by the COVID-19 pandemic, I believe that the Eid Adha presents Muslims the opportunity to pray, make sacrifices and demonstrate the key teachings of the Holy Prophet such as love, sacrifice and selflessness. “This was why I gave the directive that Eid prayer grounds should be opened to worshippers. “I celebrate with my Muslim brothers and sisters on this occasion and encourage them to continue to pray for the state and its leadership and continue to live in harmony and love. “As an administration, we also make the commitment not to take the support and love for granted as we march on in the task of repositioning our state from poverty to prosperity. “Eid Mubarak to you all and may Allah accept our sacrifices and prayers.”
