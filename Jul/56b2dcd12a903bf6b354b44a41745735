The statement read that Adekunle in his acceptance speech promised to lead the party to victory in the Oct. 10 governorship election and to run a human development based government agenda when elected. It read that Adekunle expressed his gratitude to the no fewer than 700 delegates, and to the electoral committee from the national headquarters of the party led by Alhaji Hussein Saleh-Dass. It was reported that Alhaji Saliu Adekunle is from Afin Akoko in the Akoko North-West local government Area of Ondo State.
