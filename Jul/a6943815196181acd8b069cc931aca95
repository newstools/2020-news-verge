Sen. Oluremi Tinubu, representing Lagos Central Senatorial District, has advised Muslims to keep hope alive as they celebrate the Eid-el-Kabir.  Tinubu gave the advice on Thursday in Lagos while felicitating with Muslims on this year’s celebration of Eid-el-Kabir. The Senator stressed the spiritual importance of the celebration, noting that it reminded Muslims of Prophet Ibrahim’s absolute obedience to God. “In celebrating Eid-el-Kabir, often, we emphasize his willingness to obey God, regardless of what the sacrifice entailed. “I urge you all to let the teachings of Islam, forbearance, moderation, love for your neighbour and alms giving be evident in your lives and conduct. “This year, 2020 has been tumultuous, even for the world at large. We must however trust that in spite of what is happening, everything will work out for our good,” Tinubu said. She said that even as many were unable to attend the Hajj or gather physically as they usually would in celebration of the festival, it was necessary to come to terms with the realities on ground. Tinubu noted that the celebration of the festival was also a good time to remind Nigerians that we are still in the middle of a pandemic. She added that Nigerians should ensure that they continued to abide by the directives laid down by the Government by avoiding large gatherings, observeing social distancing, washing of hands and wearing of face mask.
