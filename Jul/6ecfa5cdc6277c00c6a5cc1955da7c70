The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has debunked media reports that its Acting Chairman, Mr Ibrahim Magu, was arrested.  Spokesman of the commission, Mr Dele Oyewale, said in a statement that Magu was only invited by a “presidential panel reviewing the activities of the EFCC”. Oyewale explained that Magu honoured the invitation voluntarily at the Banquet Hall of the Presidential Villa in Abuja. He added that the the EFCC boss got the invitation while on his way to the Force Headquarters, Abuja, for a meeting. “The EFCC’s boss was neither arrested nor forced to honour the invitation. A member of a legal team from the EFCC is also with him on the panel,“ he said. The EFCC’s reaction came shortly after the Department of State Services (DSS), which is reported to have arrested Magu, also dismissed the arrest rumour by some online news sites. “The DSS wishes to inform the public that it did not arrest Ibrahim Magu as reported by sections of the media,” DSS spokesman, Dr Peter Afunanya, said in a statement.
