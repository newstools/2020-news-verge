The Oyo State Government has sent letters of gratitude to individuals and corporate organisations who contributed to the endowment fund created to tackle COVID-19 pandemic in the state.  Mr Taiwo Adisa, the Chief Press Secretary to Gov. Seyi Makinde, said in a statement on Sunday that the state has so far received N394 million cash donations. It was reported that the appreciation letter was jointly signed by the governor, the Secretary to the State Government, Mrs Olubamiwo Adeosun and Commissioner for Finance, Mr Akinola Ojo.
