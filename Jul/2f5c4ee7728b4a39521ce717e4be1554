FAAN Managing Director, Capt. Rabiu Yadudu, gave the commendation while addressing journalists at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport (NAIA) on Wednesday. Yadudu also commended airlines for their sincere adherence to guidelines of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and FAAN protocols. According to him, the reopening is purely driven by the cooperation of the stakeholders and the passengers. “We have gone ahead of the level of preparedness, it was very good. We satisfy ourselves, we satisfy the Aviation authority and now we are here. The first flight has already taken place very smoothly. “All our operations went out to be very correct. No issues, not even minor issues. The only thing is we are very surprise with the level of cooperation we got from our passengers. “There were no issues with the passengers, because we are worried of the planning put into this, it is only a plan,” he said. The managing director said the feat was as a result of months of preparation with a lot of direct and virtual meetings through the zoom network. He listed Arik, Air peace, Aero contractors, among other airlines that would start operations at the resumption. “We carefully judged all involved stakeholders preparation and expectations. Within the next 10 days, we are sure that almost all the airlines would be fully operational. “We announce Lagos to Abuja first, then later Port-Harcourt, Owerri and kano, as we are entering level of operation.

The compliance of airlines is 94 per cent and which is good enough. “By the time we run the system a couple of weeks, we will get more experiences and see how we can make it more efficient.

It is very timely as God`s time is the best. We are already here, we have started. “The passengers cooperated fully, that is why we are able to reach this stage.
