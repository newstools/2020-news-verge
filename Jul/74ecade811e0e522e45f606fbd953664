Chief Raymond Dokpesi, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has called on the Federal High Court, Abuja not to entertain the party’s case being transferred from Edo.  He was referring to the transfer of a matter with suit No: FHC/B/C569/2020 PDP V. INEC & 2 Ords from the Benin jurisdiction to Abuja by the All Progressive Party (APC). Dokpesi, who is the PDP’s Media Head of the Edo State governorship election, made this known during a media briefing on Thursday in Port Harcourt. He said that the call became necessary in order to maintain the integrity and independence of the judiciary in all matters, adding that it would also inspire confidence in the system. He said that the transfer of matter to Abuja not within its jurisdiction would likely erode the PDP’s confidence in the judiciary. He added that such transfer violates the circular of the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court dated Aug. 6, 2018 and June 24, 2020 which cautioned against entertaining matters whose cause of action falls outside its judicial divisions. Dokpesi said that on particular matter in question, the party could have sued in Abuja jurisdiction if not for the policy direction of the Chief Judge on hearing matters only within jurisdictions. “The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) National Campaign Council on Edo Governorship Election (PDPNCEG) expresses shock by the sudden demand by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to seek the transfer of our matter with suit No: FHC/B/C569/2020 PDP V. INEC & 2 Ords from the Benin jurisdiction to Abuja. “The petition of the APC therefore, contradicts the policy directive of the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court. Based on this reason, we expect the court to ignore the transfer especially, since the matter has not been heard in the Benin jurisdiction.
