The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) says it is working assiduously to restore electricity through power transformer, in Ayede Substation in Oyo State, that caught fire in early hours of Wednesday.  TCN’s General Manager, Public Affairs, Ndidi Mbah, said this in a statement in Abuja on Wednesday. She said that the company’s 150 Mega Volt Amp (MVA), 330/132/33 kilo Volt (KV) power transformer in Ayede Substation caught fire in the early hours of Wednesday. Mbah said that the fire had been contained and TCN was currently working to isolate the burnt circuits to enable the restoration of bulk supply through the substation. According to her, the incident will temporarily affect power supply to Ibadan and environs. “We therefore appeal to customers in the affected areas to bear with us as we would restore normal supply as soon as our engineers complete the restoration of the cables. “Normal bulk supply will be restored as the substation has enough redundancy to adequately transmit the DisCo load requirement,” she said. She said that the officials of the company including the head transmission service provider and general manager, transmission were already on their way to the Substation to ensure that the situation is properly attended to. Mbah however, apologised to customers in the area for inconveniences caused by the incident.
