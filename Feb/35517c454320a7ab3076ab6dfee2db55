An Ado-Ekiti Customary Court on Thursday dissolved an 11-year-old marriage between one Eunice Ajewole and her husband, Sanni Ajewole.  It was reported that both parties had earlier given their separate evidence on Jan.21, 2020 and the court fixed judgment for Feb.6. The court dissolved the marriage on the ground that Sanni deserted his wife, Eunice, for nine years while she was sick. During the hearing, Eunice, 37, who was residing along New Iyin Road in Ado-Ekiti, had told the court that she got married to her husband in 2009, under the native custom. She said that the marriage had not been blessed with any child. She said that anytime she was with her husband, she used to fall ill seriously; but that immediately she was away from him, she would get over the sickness. She added that whenever she returned to her husbandâ€™s house, the sickness would resurface; adding that she had discovered that they were not compatible. The petitioner, therefore, urged the court to dissolve the marriage between them. Also, the respondent, Sanni, 39, a resident of Oke-Agga in Otun-Ekiti, admitted that they were not compatible. He said immediately after their marriage, his wife fell ill and that anytime she was away from him; she would be well. He said that this had become too frequent and he did not want her to die in his house. He said that he never knew why the sickness was always disturbing her. Sanni, therefore, supported the dissolution of the marriage. The president of the court, Mrs Olayinka Akomolede, who observed that the marriage had broken down irretrievably, consequently, dissolved the marriage. Akomolede ruled that since there was no child between them, both parties should go their separate ways.
