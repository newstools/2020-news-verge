The EFCC on Tuesday arraigned three men in an Ikeja Special Offences Court for allegedly defrauding their employer, De-Moshadek Company Ltd of N85.5million worth of groceries.  The anti-graft agency charged Ibrahim Kuforiji, Mojeed Raheem and Habeeb Oladepo with conspiracy to steal and theft. They however, denied the charges. The EFCC Counsel, Mrs Bilikisu Buhari, told the court that the defendants committed the offence in 2019 in Lagos. She alleged that Kuforiji, Raheem and Oladepo conspired and fraudulently converted groceries worth N85.5 million belonging to De-Moshadek and Company Ltd. The prosecution alleged that the 1st defendant (Kuforiji) solely converted the sum of N15.7million which was payment to the company by wholesalers for some goods. She also alleged that Kuforiji diverted groceries worth N24.4million belonging to the company. The offence, she said contravened the provisions of sections 280 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos 2015. The counsel to the defendants, D.O Adjarho, pleaded with the court to grant the defendants bail on the most liberal terms. “They have been in custody since they were arrested on Oct. 20, 2019. ”It is on that premise that we most humbly plead at this preliminary stage that my lord tempers justice with mercy and grant them bail,”he said. Buhari, however opposed the bail application because the anti-graft agency had overwhelming evidence against the defendants. Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo admitted the defendants to bail in the sum of N10 million each with two sureties each in like sum. Justice Taiwo adjourned the case until April 9 for continuation of trial.
