Video Assistant Referees (VAR) on Saturday admitted to reaching the wrong decision after Tottenham’s Giovani Lo Celso avoided being sent off following a reckless challenge on Chelsea captain, Cesar Azpilicueta. READ: EPL: Alonso, Giroud on target as Chelsea humble Tottenham Chelsea ran out 2-1 winners in the contest but should have had it easier as Lo Celso, who stamped on Azpilicueta’s leg, was allowed to stay on the pitch despite his infringement. The incident happened shortly after the second half commenced, with video assistant referee David Coote originally reaching the conclusion that the Argentine midfielder’s actions were completely accidental. Although, a poor run of form had weakened Chelsea’s grip on fourth spot but they controlled the lunchtime derby from the moment Frenchman Giroud, making his first league start since November, rifled home in the 15th minute. Spaniard Alonso, back for only his seventh league start after falling out of favour under coach Frank Lampard, doubled the lead three minutes after the interval with a thumping left-foot finish at Stamford Bridge.
