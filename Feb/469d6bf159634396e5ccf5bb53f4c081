Mr Joseph Ugwuoke, Chairman, All Progressives Congress (APC) in Nsukka Local Government Area (LGA) of Enugu State, has urged Enugu State Independent Electoral Commission (ENSIEC) to ensure that Feb. 29 local government poll is credible.  Ugwuoke made the appeal in an interview with our reporter in Nsukka on Thursday. He said that ENSIEC should allow the will of the electorate to prevail during that election by conducting an election that would be described by all as free and fair. “The commission should ensure the votes of the people of Enugu State count in that election. “I urge ENSIEC to give every political party an equal level playing ground during the election and resists any attempt by any politician to use their staff to commit electoral fraud. “The state electoral umpire should ensure that the staff and ad-hoc staff exhibit high level of transparency and honesty during the exercise so that only candidates that have mandates of the electorate will emerge victorious,” he said. Ugwoke said that Mr Sunday Ugwuoke, a lawyer, is the Chairmanship candidate of APC in Nsukka LGA as well as 19 councillorship candidates from the area. “Nsukka LGA has twenty wards and it is only in Eha-Ndiagu ward that the party has no councillorship candidate. “The party has confidence in its candidates that are contesting the election and optimistic they will emerge victorious at the poll,” he said. The APC chieftain noted that the party would flag off its campaign for the election tomorrow (Friday) at Nsukka APC party secretariat. Ugwoke said that the ceremony would be attended by many party supporters from the 20 wards as well as officials from the zone and state party secretariat. “After the flag off, we will go from ward to ward to canvass and solicit votes from residents of Nsukka LGA. “I am assuring Nsukka residents that if APC candidates are elected on Feb. 29, the party will ensure it takes Nsukka LGA to the next level,” he said.
