Leading telecommunications services provider, Airtel Nigeria, has
reaffirmed its support for underprivileged children as it pledges to build
modern toilet facilities as well as donate educational materials to the pupils
of Methodist Central Primary School in Uruan Local Government Area of
Akwa-Ibom State. Airtel is offering this support as part of the ongoing Season 5 of its flagship
Corporate Social Responsibility programme, Airtel Touching Lives, which
will air on Sunday, February 23 rd .Episode 4 documents the heartfelt story of Methodist Central Primary
School in Akwa-Ibom State, which had been in a state of disrepair, with no
toilet facilities, furniture or adequate learning materials for its over 900
pupils. For several decades, the school had lacked power, potable water, first-aid
kits as well as modern toilets, and pupils had to share an unhygienic pit
latrine, putting them at risk of infections and diseases. Despite the situation
of the school, the teachers remained steadfast in imparting knowledge to
the pupils as well as discharging their duties. However, the conditions had become quite dire in recent times, leaving the
teachers frustrated and bereft of hope. The upcoming episode will show
how Airtel promised to intervene and turn around the situation.
Last week, Episode 3 of the programme documented the story of
Omishakin, a small community in Ogun State that had been without
electricity for over 13 years, hampering businesses and affecting livelihood
of community members. The community was also faced with security problems owing to the lack of
power as hoodlums swarmed its environs in the dark, putting lives and
properties at constant risk. Community members also had to walk long
distances to fetch potable water as commercial boreholes were no longer
sustainable as their owners could not continue to fuel their power
generating sets.
