Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State says the state does not require the services of any other security outfit, apart from those recognised by the laws of the country.  Ganduje said this when he received the new Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG), Zone One, Mr Sadiq Bello on a courtesy visit in his office in kano. Mr Abba Anwar, the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, said this in a statement on Thursday in Kano. He said that the Kano people were satisfied with the performance of government-owned security agencies operating in the state. “We are satisfied with the effectiveness of the security agencies operating in the state, we are also happy with the synergy between us and them. “We do not intend to come up with any security outfit that will give security responsibilities to people who are not trained and do not understand how security works,” he said. Ganduje said that security agencies in the state were working together to ensure effective crime control, saying that they had been very effective. He said that establishing private security outfits would be counter-productive and inimical to law and order in the long run. “As a government, we will not get involved in anything that will turn out to become another security challenge. “The hisbah which we have in place is working in synergy with the police, they cannot be allowed to function as separate security entity,” he said. The governor assured that all states under the police zonal command, would continue to work together to ensure peace and security within the area. In his remarks, Bello commended Ganduje for his commitment towards providing conducive environment for security agencies to operate in the state. He expressed readiness to be objective and professional in the performance of his duties. “We shall partner with stakeholders to ensure that the states under our watch enjoy efficient crime policing,” he said.
