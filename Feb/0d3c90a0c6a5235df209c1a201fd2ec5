Tyson Fury on Sunday says his career would be “completed” if he faced fellow Briton Anthony Joshua after becoming a two-time world heavyweight champion with a stunning win over Deontay Wilder. Fury, 31, stopped Wilder in seven rounds of their Las Vegas rematch to claim the WBC title four years on from giving up the IBF, WBO and WBA belts now held by Joshua. Wilder can request a rematch, but Fury pointed to a meeting with Joshua if that does not happen. He said: “I’ve got another old fella across the pond who might want a little tickle. “Then that is it then. It’s completed. Done.”
