The Federal Government says President Muhammadu Buhari will not resign because he has the overwhelming mandate of Nigerians to preside over the affairs of the country until the expiration of his tenure in May 2023.  The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed stated this at a media briefing in Abuja, Mohammed was reacting to “diversionary statements by some commentators, especially political and religious leaders” calling for Buhari’s resignation over purported spate of insecurity. The minister conceded that the country was facing security challenges but they were being tackled headlong. “There have been some red herrings in recent times, including those calling for the resignation of Mr President or the sack of the security chiefs. “I just want to say that the government, which has provided and continues to provide the military and the security agencies with the wherewithal, believes in their ability to tackle insecurity. “These challenges will be successfully tackled. I will however advice all commentators, especially political and religious leaders, to be very careful at this time not to aggravate the situation with incendiary comments. “These are comments that cash in on our religious, ethnic and political fault lines to further divide us,” he said. Mohammed stressed that the kind of comments that have been attributed to some leaders, especially religious leaders, are incendiary and reckless. “Leaders should be part of solutions to problems, rather than aggravating situations. To those asking Mr. President to resign, “I wish to say this: Mr President will not resign. He has the overwhelming mandate of Nigerians to preside over the affairs of the country till the expiration of his tenure in May 2023,” he said.
