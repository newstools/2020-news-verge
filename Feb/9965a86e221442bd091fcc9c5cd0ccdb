The Presidency has dismissed an online report alleging that Zahra, daughter of President Muhammadu Buhari, had fraudulently secured a job with the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA).  The President’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, in a statement in Abuja on Wednesday, described the publication as fake, untrue and meant to cast aspersions at the First Family. He said: “An online medium given particularly to fake news publishes that Zahra, daughter of President Muhammadu Buhari, has fraudulently secured a job with the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA). “While Zahra, just like any other Nigerian, can work wherever she secures employment, we hasten to add that the story is false in every material particular. “The publication is untrue, malicious, and meant to cast aspersions at the First Family, since the tendentious platform claims the job was secured fraudulently. “All people of goodwill are enjoined to ignore the hack piece, masquerading as a news story.’’
