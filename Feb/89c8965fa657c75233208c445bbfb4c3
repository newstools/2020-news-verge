The United States of America ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard, has said the recent visa ban to Nigerians will be reviewed, if certain conditions are met. She stated this while speaking during a courtesy visit to the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, in Abuja, on Tuesday. Leonard explained that the US wants Nigeria to sort out problems with information sharing. “I need to clarify something for you here. The immigrant visa ban does not affect people who are currently resident in the United States. It does not cancel the status of anyone who currently lives in the United States. “What Secretary Pompey said was that it was meant to be temporary. And it is about problems with information sharing which are investigable, achievable and resolvable and we look forward to Nigeria in a very short time being able to meet those information sharing goal so that the decision can be reviewed,” she said. US president, Donald Trump, has imposed a visa ban that ensures immigration from Nigeria is no longer possible.
