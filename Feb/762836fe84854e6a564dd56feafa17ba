The Oyo State Chapter of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), on Friday applauded Gov. Seyi Makinde, over the signing of agreement on the implementation of N30, 000 minimum wage for the state’s workers.  The state’s NLC chairman, Bayo Titilayo-Sodo, who made this known in a telephone interview with our reporter, said that it was a welcome development and pleasing to hear. “It was a joint agreement and I must tell you it was a good development that we are able to agree to the implementation of the national minimum wage for our workers. “It is the first time in the history of the state that agreement would be reached without any breakdown of talks, intimidation or harassment of any form. “I also have to inform you, and indeed our members that the agreement stipulated review from time to time depending on some variables such as income generation, productivity, among others,” he said. It was reported that with the implementation of the new minimum wage of N30, 000 by the Federal Government, with effect from April 2019, other states have continued to follow suit.
