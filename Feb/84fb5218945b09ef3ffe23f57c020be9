Enugu State Civil Servants on Tuesday paid a ‘thank you visit’ to Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi for the payment of the new minimum wage in the state.  Our correspondent reports that the state government started the payment of the new wage over the weekend. The workers trekked a distance of about 10km from the state secretariat to the Government House, Enugu, to register their appreciation. The Chairman, Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Enugu State Council, Mr Virginus Nwobodo, said that it was the first time the state government was implementing a new wage structure without any industrial action by workers. Nwobodo said that the workers were happy that the state government heeded to the yearnings of the workers. On the noticeable disparities and inconsistencies in the salaries received, Nwobodo requested those that were underpaid to report such discrepancies to the council. Also, the Chairman, Trade Union Congress (TUC), Enugu State Council, Mr Ben Asogwa, described the outcome of the new wage structure as a ‘product of collective bargaining.’ Asogwa said that workers in the state had for several years worked without a salary chart. Responding, Ugwuanyi thanked the workers for their unflinching support for his administration. The governor said that their mandate was to serve residents of the state with the fear of God. He commended the workers for their patience while the negotiation lasted. Ugwuanyi said that his administration would continually recognise workers as its great allies and partners. Our correspondent further reports of complaints of inconsistencies in the payment of the new minimum wage. Some of the workers, who spoke to our correspondent anonymously, said that some workers on the same grade level and step in the same ministry were paid different amounts.
