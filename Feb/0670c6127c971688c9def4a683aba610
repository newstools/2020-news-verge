Ologbondiyan disclosed that the NEC also appointed the party Deputy National Secretary, Dr Emmanuel Agbo, as secretary of the committee, adding that two persons were drawn from each of the six geopolitical zones to constitute the 14-man committee. Members of the committee include former governor of Jigawa State, Sule Lamido and a former Minister of Special Duties, Taminu Turaki (North West); former Speaker, House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara and Hassan Baduge (North East).
