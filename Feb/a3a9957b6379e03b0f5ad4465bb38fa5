An Ilorin Area Court on Thursday dissolved a 5-year-old marriage between one Sherifat Olanrewaju and Suleiman Yakubu over wife’s claim of lack of maintenance in the union.  The plaintiff, Sherifat, a resident of Isale Koto Area, Ilorin had approached the court, seeking dissolution of her marriage to Suleiman for not taking care of her. The petitioner said the defendant always starve her and their only child by not providing for their needs.

The defendant did not object to the prayer of the plaintiff, saying she is free to go in peace. “My Lord, I am not also interested in her anymore. “She can go as she pleases,’’ Yakubu said. The Presiding Judge Abdulhameed Aliyu dissolved the marriage and awarded certificate of divorce to the plaintiff.
