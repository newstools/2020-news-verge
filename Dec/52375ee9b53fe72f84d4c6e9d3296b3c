The South African national lottery has recorded a world first by announcing the winning numbers for this week’s draw as the following six consecutive numbers (5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10).  There were 20 winners and the US$ 7,433,630 jackpot will be split evenly among them. The Lottery Commission has rejected claims that Tuesday’s draw may have been tampered with, saying the results have been audited. It tweeted that “these numbers may be unexpected, but we see many players opt to play these sequences”. Mathematicians say there are about 14 million possible combinations and this draw was simply a coincidence. Most lottery players choose calendar numbers, such as birth dates or anniversaries, so the most popular numbers are 1 through 31.
