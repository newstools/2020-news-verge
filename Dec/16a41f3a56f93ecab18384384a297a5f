Some hoodlums accosted INEC officials as they prepared to commence voting during Saturday’s by-election at Unit 13, Kosofe council area of Lagos State.  Our correspondent who was at the centre reports that the hoodlums insisted on collecting money from INEC officials before voting could commence. An INEC ad-hoc staff, Mrs Monsurat Aladeloba, told our correspondent that the hoodlums got to the unit at about 8:37 a.m, brandishing dangerous weapons. It was reported that the INEC ad-hoc staff packed up their materials so as to relocate from the area in the midst of the confrontation between some electorate and the hoodlums. “The boys were about fighting themselves when more police officers were drafted here,” she said. It was reported that the the situation was later brought under control at about 10 a.m. following intervention of some community leaders in the area. One of the community leaders, Alhaji Gbenga Mola, said that the hoodlums had been taken care of and assured the INEC officials of their safety. “There will be no problem here. I have talked to the boys. Election is holding here,” he said. It was reported that voting later commenced at about 10.15 a.m. Meanwhile, an All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Mr Femi Saheed, contesting for Kosofe Constituency 2 in the Lagos State House of Assembly, commended the peaceful conduct of the election in the area. Saheed, who voted at Unit 003, Aina Road, Kosofe, at about 10.28 a.m, commended INEC for the logistics. Our correspondent observed that unlike in Ojota/Ogudu areas where there was voter apathy, there was massive voter turnout at Agility in Mile 12 area of Lagos.
