The Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu, on Monday, reiterated commitment to supporting wheat and rice farmers in the dry season farming in the state.  Bagudu affirmed this while receiving members of Gendi-Gendi Rice Farmers Association, Birnin Kebbi. He said, “The government will soon begin disbursement of necessary assistance to farmers affected by recent flooding in the state, including provision of agricultural input.” The governor advised youth and farmers to always approach the state government for support through groups and associations for easy accessibility. Earlier, the leader of the association, Malam Alhaji Dan-Alhaji, said members of the group had taken up farming diligently, cultivating wheat and rice fields away from political thuggery. “The aim of coming here is to solicit for material support to embark on dry season farming, considering the lost we incurred in the recent floods in the state,” he said. Dan-Alhaji requested the governor to assist farmers with fertilizer, water -pumping machine, pesticides, herbicides, and other agricultural implements at subsidized rate to maximizing production. He also commended Bagudu for his encouragement, support and good counselling which motivated them to embark on production of rice and other crops. “We assure you of our unflinching support to this administration to actualise the agricultural revolution agenda of President Muhammadu Buhari,” the chairman pledged.
