The Ifo Unit Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Ogun has advised motorists to exercise patience and drive with caution to stem road crashes during the Yuletide.  The Commander of the unit, Mr Joshua Ibitomi, gave the advice in an interview with our reporter on Thursday in Ota, Ogun. It was reported that the Federal Government had on Wednesday declared Dec. 25 and Dec. 28, 2020 as well as Jan. 1, 2021 as public holidays for the citizens to celebrate Christmas and the New Year festivities respectively. Ibitomi said that the advice had become necessary as motorists are always in a hurry during the festive season to arrive at their destinations without being conscious of the safety measures on the roads. “The FRSC implores motorists to exercise patience and adhere strictly to traffic rules and regulations to avoid carnage on the roads. “In addition, they need to drive defensively by not speeding as well as shun driving under the influence of intoxicating substances that can endanger their lives and those of other road users,” he said. The commander said FRSC personnel from the unit would be deployed to various strategic locations to control gridlocks and check the excesses of drivers. He also advised drivers to strictly follow COVID-19 pandemic protocols which include: washing of hands and the use of alcohol-base sanitiser, use of face masks, keeping physical and social distancing to further flatten the curve of the virus.
