The Market Traders Association of Nigeria (MATAN) has appealed to Gov. Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State to give more time for the planned demolition of 6000 shops in Unguwan Rimi market, Kaduna.  Alhaji Jamilu Abbas, the President of the association, made the appeal in a statement in Abuja on Sunday, saying the COVID-19 had affected their businesses. Abbas said though MATAN was aware of ongoing urban renewal programme of the government, but more time should be given to the affected traders to relocate. He explained that his members had suffered huge losses during the lockdown and they were yet to recover from its devastating effects. “Our attention was drawn to a newspaper report on the plan by Kaduna State Government to demolish about 6000 shops in Unguwan Rimi Market. “We are appealing to Governor El-Rufai to temper his directive with mercy considering the challenges mentioned above. “Our traders are still counting their losses as a result of shutdown of businesses during the lockdown. “Another reason is the insecurity issues including kidnapping and banditry which mostly affect traders who move from market to market in search of legitimate means of livelihood. “The issue of EndSARS had equally affected some of our members, this is why we feel this is not the right time,” he said. The president, however, disclosed that the association had written to the state government to plead to halt the demolition plan for now.
