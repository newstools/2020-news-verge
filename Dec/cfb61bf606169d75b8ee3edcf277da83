The Federal Government has cautioned Nigerians against indiscriminate bush burning to avert fire disasters in the dry season.  Minister of Interior, Mr Rauf Aregbesola, gave the advise on Monday in Akure, during the inauguration of a fire fighting truck in Ondo State. It was reported that the federal government donated a 6,000 litre capacity truck to Ondo state. The minister advised smokers against careless disposal of cigarette butts, describing fire as a humble messenger when properly managed. He said that adherence to safety precautions, apart from preventing fire disasters, could save lives and prevent loss of property. Aregbesola also encouraged Nigerians to be committed to preventing, mitigating and quelling fire disasters. Earlier, Dr Liman Ibrahim, Controller-General, Federal Fire Service, said the 6,000 litres fire fighting truck had the capacity of roof and ground engagement. Also speaking, Gov. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo state, commended the federal government for providing the fire fighting truck for the state. Akeredolu also enjoined residents of the state to always switch off electrical appliances when not in use as a preventive measure against fire disasters.
