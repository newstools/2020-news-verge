The Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance, Sen. Solomon Adeola, has urged Christians to renew their faith in Jesus Christ as they celebrate Christmas.  The senator, in a Christmas message on Thursday, also urged his constituents and Nigerians in general to observe all prescribed guidelines against COVID-19 during the period. Adeola (APC-Lagos West) said that “Christmas symbolises the celebration of the birth of a new dawn for the salvation of all humanity, especially for Christians”. . While saying the occasion should be joyous with merry-making, the senator called for caution in such display of positive emotion in view of threats of the second wave of COVID-19. He said in line with the Federal Government’s directive banning all large gatherings over the second wave of the virus, he had cancelled his annual end-of-the-year party for his constituents. “The year 2020 is a challenging year globally; in compliance with prescribed COVID-19 protocols, I have cancelled the end-of-the-year party that I organise annually to meet and celebrate with thousands of my constituents. “However, as is equally my tradition, I have made provisions in cash and kind for joyous celebration in homes of my constituents”, he said. Adeola noted that Nigerians were going through a difficult period as COVID-19 had caused many citizens to lose their sources of income. He, however, expressed optimism that 2021 would be a better year, especially as COVID-19 vaccines had been developed, and that the country would most likely exit recession by the first quarter. “I urge all Nigerians to be patient and look forward to a better future. ”With abiding faith in Jesus Christ, all our challenges will be a thing of the past as we move to, hopefully, a glorious New Year”, he said.
