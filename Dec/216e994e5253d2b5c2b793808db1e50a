The Vice Chancellor of University of Calabar, Prof. Florence Banku-Obi, has assured members of the National Universities Commission (NUC) that her administration will not compromise on standard and quality of education.  Banku-Obi gave the assurance on Monday in Calabar when members of the NUC Resource Verification Team, who were at the institution for a verification exercise, paid her a courtesy call in her office. The vice chancellor, who underscored the importance of the verification exercise, said she would work with the team to ensure a hitch-free exercise. She added that her administration would strive hard to enthrone academic excellence in the institution. Banku-Obi, who said that human and material resources were in place, however, decried the level of destruction, occasioned by the #EndSARS protest on Oct. 24 in Calabar, which, she said, was hijacked by hoodlums. According to her, the destruction has greatly affected some programmes which have not yet been fixed. “As a team, I want you to carry out your work without fear or favour. My administration will not compromise on standard,” she said. Earlier, Mrs Anthonia Bawa, who spoke on behalf of the NUC team, congratulated Banku-Obi on her emergence as the first female vice chancellor of the university. She said that the team was on a visit to assess the various programmes of the institution with a view to ensuring that they met the NUC standard. Bawa assured that the team would work with an open mind to assess the available human and material resources at the Faculties of Pharmacy, Education, Environmental Sciences and Social Sciences.
