This is contained in a statement issued by the Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr Humwashi Wonosikou, on Friday in Yola. “This is to allow school children go home early for the Christmas and New Year celebrations. “The schools are to resume for the second term on Jan. 11, 2021,” the governor said, adding that the directive should be strictly adhered to by school managers. It was reported that the directive is unconnected with the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was also reported that many schools in Yola, the state capital, had closed since Dec. 16.
