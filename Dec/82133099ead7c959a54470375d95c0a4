The governor further assured residents of adequate security for hitch-free Christmas and New Year celebrations. Meanwhile, The Chaplain of the Government House Chapel, Eunice Oyeyemi, a pastor with Christ Embassy Church, Abakaliki, admonished Christian faithful to always serve God in truth to attract His blessings.
