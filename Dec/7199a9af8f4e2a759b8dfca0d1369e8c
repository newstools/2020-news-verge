Prof. Florence Obi, the new Vice Chancellor (VC) of the University of Calabar, says she will accord priority attention to staff welfare and training to ensure increased productivity in the institution.  Obi said this on Wednesday when the executive members of the Association of Nigerian University Professional Administrators (ANUPA), Unical chapter paid her a courtesy visit. The VC, who stressed the need for training and re-training of administrators, called on the association to adhere strictly to the tenets of the profession. According to her, members of the association should display a high level of professionalism in the discharge of their duties. “As professional administrators, professionalism should be your watchword, proper ethics should be your watchword, your attitude to work matters because it will help the university to grow. “Staff development and training are paramount in any organisation and that is one of the cardinal objectives of my administration. We would work closely with ANUPA to ensure adequate training of staff,’’ she said. According to her, a motivated member of staff will be committed to discharging his or her duties effectively, as her administration has placed staff welfare on the front burner. Earlier, the Chairman of ANUPA, Mr George Fortune, said the visit was to congratulate the Vice Chancellor on her emergence as the first female VC of the institution. Describing her appointment as ‘strategic fortune’, she promised to join hands with the VC to take the institution to an enviable height. The chairman, who underscored the need for training of administrators, applauded the VC for showing keen interest on training and staff welfare, which he said, would boost staff productivity.
