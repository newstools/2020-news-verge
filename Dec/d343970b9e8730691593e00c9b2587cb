Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has signed into law the state’s 2021 budget, amounting to N177.9 billion after the approval of the state assembly.  Recall that Ganduje had on Oct. 27 presented over N147.9 billion budget estimate before the assembly for approval. It was also recalled that the assembly, after deliberations on the N147.9 billion, had increased it to N177.9 billion. The governor, while signing the budget tagged ‘Budget of Reality’, commended the assembly for doing everything possible to approve the budget within a short time. He also commended the lawmakers for organising public hearings aimed at getting the views of the people on their needs. According to him, the approved 2021 budget will focus on the provision of quality education, good health infrastructure and other developmental projects. He pointed out that the budget is lower than that of 2020 due to the economic challenges occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. Ganduje added that: “It is not the size of the budget that matters to us, but to be able to achieve 90 per cent implementation”. Presenting the approved budget, the Speaker Kano State House of Assembly, Hamisu Ibrahim-Chidari said public inputs were obtained through the public hearing which assisted the house in approving the proposed estimate. He gave the assurance that the assembly would support the executive arm towards moving the state forward.
