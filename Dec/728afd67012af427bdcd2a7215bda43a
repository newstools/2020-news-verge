Former spokesman of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), Mr Olisa Metuh on Thursday released from Kuje prison, Abuja. Metuh’s release from prison followed the nullification of a seven-year jail sentence handed down to him by an Appeal Court sitting in Abuja. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had arraigned Metuh on seven counts of money laundering for allegedly receiving N400 million from the office of the national security adviser. On February 25, 2020, the trial court pronounced him guilty on all counts of money laundering and sentenced him to seven years in prison. Read here. Mr Olisa Metuh however, approached the Appeal Court to challenge his sentencing. The court in its ruling said that Justice Okon Abang who handed Metuh the jail term exhibited bias in the case and so nullified the jail term.
