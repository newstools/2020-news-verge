The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Sagamu Unit Command, has advised passengers to caution any reckless and erring driver to reduce mishaps during the News Year celebration.  Mr Taofiq Iyanda, Sagamu Unit Commander, gave the advice in an interview with our reporter on Tuesday in Ota, Ogun. Iyanda said that the advice had become necessary as passengers do not pay drivers money to kill but rather to take them safely to their various destinations. “Passengers have the right to caution drivers and report anyone who refuses to listen to warnings to the next available law enforcement agency to avoid unnecessary loss of lives. “Before embarking on any journey, passengers have the right to inspect any vehicles and ensure that tyres and others necessary things in such vehicles are in good condition,’’ he said. The unit commander warned drivers against excessive speeding, noting that most of the crashes recorded during Christmas were caused by over-speeding. He also admonished drivers against night travelling due to current security challenges in the country. “They should prepare their journey early by ensuring that their vehicles are in proper conditions and leave early so they will not be in hurry to reach the destination,’’ he said. Iyanda advised drivers to ensure that they have extra tyres, functional rear light and fire extinguisher while on a journey. The FRSC boss further warned that vehicles, used for inter-state journeys, should be put in good condition before take-off to avoid crashes. He added that FRSC personnel had been stationed along Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and Lagos-Benin Expressway since Dec. 20 to remove obstructions, crashes and anything that might impede free traffic flows on the roads.
