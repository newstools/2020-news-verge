Pastor Enoch Adeboye, the General Overseer, Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), will, on Dec. 23, visit Okitipupa, Okitipupa Local Government Area of Ondo State for the ‘Let’s Go-A-fishing’ programme.  Pastor Johnson Umoren, the Pastor-In-Charge, Ondo Province 5, RCCG, Holiness Cathedral, Okitipupa, disclosed this in an interview with our reporter on Wednesday in Okitipupa. Umoren said preparations were in top gear to receive Adeboye in the town, particularly in the areas of security, medicals and prayers, among others. He added that the general overseer would be speaking on the theme: “The Voice of Hope”, adding it was a divine intervention for the town that had witnessed lots of hopelessness in recent times. Umoren urged residents to come out en masse to receive salvations, blessings, breakthroughs, healings, open doors and divine hope of greater things, among others at the programme, holding at Stellamaris College in the town. He added that all RCCG branches in Okitipupa would walk round the town on Dec. 20 to create awareness for the programme. “We urge residents to bring their sick people, because the blind will see, the cripple will walk and the sick will be healed, in Jesus name. “I believe God will walk through Okitipupa and its environs to restore hope to those in situation of hopelessness,” Umoren said.
