The Department of State Services (DSS) says the service is collaborating with other security agencies to ensure that adequate measures are put in place for protection of lives and property before, during and after the yuletide.  Dr Peter Afunanya, the Public Relations Officer of the service, gave the assurance in a statement issued in Abuja, calling on citizens to be more vigilant and report strange movements and all suspicions around them to security and law enforcement agencies. He expressed concern that although there were indications that criminal elements were planning to attack public places, including vulnerable points during the yuletide, security and safety of citizens were guaranteed. Afunanya said that the objective of the planned attack was to create a general sense of fear among the people and subsequently undermine the government. “Against this backdrop, citizens are called upon to be extra vigilant and report strange movements and indeed, all suspicions around them to security and law enforcement agencies. “On its part, the service is collaborating with other sister agencies to ensure that adequate measures are put in place for protection of lives and property. “To achieve this, the service has provided these emergency response numbers 08132222105 and 09030002189 for urgent contacts,” he said. According to him, the service is also using this opportunity to unveil its interactive website www.dss.gov.ng for public communication support. He urged the public to take advantage of the platforms and similar ones provided by related agencies to timely reach and avail security agencies of required information. Afunanya warned those planning to cause chaos and damage to public peace to desist from the act, adding that it would stop at nothing to apprehend and bring them to justice. He pledged the commitment of the service to safety of citizens and residents during and after the festive periods.
