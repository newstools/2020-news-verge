Gov. Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa has called on traditional rulers to promote unity and peaceful co-existence in their respective domains for the development of the state and the nation.  Fintiri made the call during the coronation and presentation of first class staff of office to the 29th Hama Bachama, Dr Daniel Ismaila, in Numan on Wednesday. The governor said that the foundations of peace in any society were justice and commitment. Fintiri congratulated Ismaila on his emergence as the 29th Haman Bachama and saluted the courage and sportsmanship of the other contestants. He advised the Haman Bachama to involve the contestants in his leadership of his kingdom. In his address Ismaila, who is also the Chairman of Bachama Traditional Council, assured the people of his commitment to ensuring justice, fairness, peace and progress among the people. He said that he would strive to ensure that those who wished to do legitimate business with the people were encouraged and allowed to have peace. He said that he would meet regularly with security agencies to promote the rule of law, justice and security for all. “I will make it a point of duty to collaborate with all neighbours towards promoting unity and peaceful co-existence. “We have to make frantic and deliberate efforts to rebuild our broken relationship and restore the confidence we once had in one another. “We should begin to emphasise those things that unite us and ignore, down play or deliberately discard those things that tend to ignite conflicts that keep us embattled and separated,” he said.
