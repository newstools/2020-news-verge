As the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) intensify ember months patrol, the Sector Commander in Borno, Sanusi Ibrahim, has warned personnel against taking bribe from erring motorists.  Speaking at a meeting with Commanding Officers from Local Government Areas in the state on Tuesday in Maiduguri, Ibrahim said the Corps has zero tolerance on bribery. He added that the sector command would not hesitate to deal with any personnel caught in the act. “You must make this clear to your men on patrol as well as motorists who think they can bribe our personnel when caught for traffic offences,’’ he said. Ibrahim also tasked them on punctuality at their duty posts and on the need to continue to collaborate with security agencies in ensuring a secured highway. With the second wave of COVID-19 in the country, the sector commander urged personnel to ensure that commercial drivers should comply with protocol in loading their vehicles. He said that a meeting had been held with transporters on the need for compliance with the COVID-19 protocols. “A vehicle, carrying six passengers, is now to carry four; all occupants must wear a face mask while hand-washing points must be provided with sanitisers in all parks.’’ He lauded the improvement in reduction of road accidents in the state this year and appealed for all stakeholders’ support to the corps for more successes.
