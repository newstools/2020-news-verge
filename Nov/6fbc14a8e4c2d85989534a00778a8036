The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has re-arraigned one Abiodun Sodiq, before an Ikeja Special Offences Court, for allegedly defrauding a businessman of 40,000 euros over Malta citizenship.  Sodiq was re-arraigned on a seven-count charge involving forgery and conspiracy to which he pleaded not guilty. According to Mr Nkereuwem Anana, the EFFC prosecutor, the defendant known with the alias, Bunmi Sodiq, committed the offences between May 14 and July 23, 2019. “He defrauded a businessman, Mr Babatunde Emmanuel of 40,000euros under the guise that the funds would be used for the Malta Government Citizenship Investment Programme as well as procurement of Malta international passport. “Within that time, he also forged various international passports in the names of Oyinlola Vincent, Ashinedun Vincent, Emanuel Babalola, Olayinka Babatunde and Adekunle Babatunde. “He fraudulently claimed that the forged international passports emanated from the Passport Office, Malta,” he said. The offences contravene Sections 1(1)(a)(3) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Related Offences Act 2006, and Section 363 of the Criminal Law of Lagos, 2011. The defence counsel, Ms Elizabeth Ezerhume, in her submission, said the defendant’s application for the release of his international passport was pending before the court. Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo noted that the defendant would enjoy the bail previously granted him during his first arraignment. She adjourned the case until Dec. 7 for ruling and trial.
