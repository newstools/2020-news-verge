The nation’s bourse on Tuesday halted three consecutive days bearish posture with a growth of N113 billion due to interest rate retention at 11.5 per cent.  Speficially, the market capitalisation rose by N113 billion to close at N17.943 trillion from N17.830 trillion achieved on Monday. Also, the All-Share Index which opened at 34,121.78 rose by 218.78 points or 0.64 per cent to close at 34,340.56. Our correspondent reports that the apex bank’s Monetary Policy Committee members, at the last meeting for the year, voted to hold all policy variables. The retention came on the back of the recent National Bureau of Statistics report which confirmed that the economy slipped into recession as GDP contracted by 3.62 per cent in the third quarter. Consequently, the committee decided to hold Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 11.5 per cent; retained Cash Reserves Ratio at 27.5 per cent; and liquidity ratio at 30 per cent.
