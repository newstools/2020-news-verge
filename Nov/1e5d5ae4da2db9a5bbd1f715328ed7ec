Tinubu Vanguard, a political pressure group has lauded Gov. Dave Umahi of Ebonyi for defecting from Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to All Progressives Congress (APC).  This is contained in a statement by Dr Johnny Ben the director of the group on Thursday in Abuja. Ben said that Umahi’s decision to work with the ruling party was in the best interest of the South East. “The defection of Umahi to APC is a welcome development and we commend him for the timely decision which is in the best for the South East zone. “We also congratulate APC for having one of the best governors in the South East in its fold. “We urge the party to remain steadfast and upright in its dealings, by maintaining best political practices which are lacking in the opposition party,’’ he said. He commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his resilience in executing development projects across the country; especially in the South East in spite of government’s limited resources. “This is part of what must have convinced the governor and some other stakeholders to align with the APC so as to consolidate those gains. “The people of the South East should appreciate Mr President and join hands with the APC to further position the zone at the centre to attract more infrastructure projects as well as political placements,’’ he said. Ben urged Nigerians at home and in Diaspora to support the government in its efforts to reposition the country towards making it great again.
