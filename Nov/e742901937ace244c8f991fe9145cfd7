President Muhammadu Buhari will on Dec.1, roll out the National Gas Expansion Programme (NGEP) to deepen domestic usage of gas in the country.  This is contained in a statement by Alhaji Garba Deen Muhammad, Special Adviser on Media to Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Chief Timipre Sylva, in Abuja, on Sunday. He said the event would herald the formal dispensing of autogas (Compressed Natural Gas, CNG and Liquefied Petroleum Gas, LPG) products at two NNPC Retail stations. “The roll out is the culmination of the resolve of the President Buhari-led Government to deepen domestic usage of natural gas in its various forms. “It is also in line with the government’s plan to make gas the first choice source of cheaper and cleaner energy for Nigerians in their personal and industrial endeavours,” he said. He added that Sylva on behalf of the Federal Government would handover CNG-powered mass transport buses to the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC). This, he said, was part of the agreement reached with labour during negotiations and in recognition of the role organised labour played in the quest to bring relief to ordinary Nigerians. “The Federal Government Autogas program will deliver at least one million vehicle conversions by the end of 2021. “It will herald the clean energy transition for Nigeria and delivery of cheap transportation fuel,” he added.
