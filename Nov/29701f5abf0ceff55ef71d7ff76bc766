Pope Francis on Monday offered his All Souls prayers especially for those who lost their lives due to the coronavirus pandemic.  “Today we pray for all the #Faithful Departed and especially for the victims of the #Coronavirus, for those who have died alone, without the caress of their loved ones; and for those who have given their lives serving the sick,” the pontiff wrote on Twitter. Later in the day, Francis was due to lead an All Souls mass in the Teutonic Cemetery within the grounds of the Vatican and pray by the graves of his predecessors in the Vatican Grottoes under St Peter’s Basilica.
