The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Taraba command, says it has begun aggressive ’ember’ months road safety campaign to secure lives of road users during and after the festive period.  Mr Edwards Zamber, Zonal Commanding Officer, RS3 Yola, said this while inaugurating the campaign at Owoniyi Motor Park in Jalingo on Thursday. He said that the exercise was a yearly tradition to remind motorists of the need to be safety conscious while celebrating. Zamber, who is in charge of Adamawa, Gombe and Taraba states, urged motorists to keep the theme of the 2020 campaign- “Drive Safe, Stay Safe” in mind as they travel. Speaking earlier, Corps Commander, Selina Williams, Taraba Sector Commander of FRSC, said the campaign was aimed at enhancing the thought process of all the stakeholders on safety, especially drivers and passengers as the festive period approaches. “The timing is appropriate because of the expected rise in vehicular movements of passengers and goods to celebrate yuletide with loved ones. “The consequences of road traffic violations and numerous others lead to avoidable road crashes resulting to loss of lives and properties, thus turning the celebration into sorrow and anguish,” she said. Williams listed speed limit violation, overload violation, tyre violation among others as major causes of road crashes that must be avoided while driving. She also advised motorists and passengers to abide by the COVID -19 protocols to prevent further spread of the disease. Williams commended Gov. Darius Ishaku of Taraba over the ongoing construction of fly-over and road expansion in Jalingo. She appealed to the governor to reconstruct and expand the main motor park in Jalingo and relocate markets along highways to complement the beauty of the city.
