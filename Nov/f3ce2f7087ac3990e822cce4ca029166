First Bank of Nigeria Plc says its mobile banking application, FirstMobile, has won the 2020 Best Mobile Banking App award 2020 in the Global Finance Best Digital Bank Awards 2020.  Mr Gbenga Shobo, Deputy Managing Director of the bank, disclosed this in a statement made available to our reporter on Tuesday in Lagos. Shobo said that the achievement was largely attributable to the bank’s relative strength and success of its web products and services, specifically, FirstMobile. “The Global Finance 2020 Best Mobile Banking App award is testament to our continuous commitment to putting our customers first which was demonstrated in our recent upgrade of the leading mobile banking application, FirstMobile. “The upgrade on FirstMobile is designed to suit the social pattern and lifestyle of all our customers. “We dedicate this award to all customers and appreciate Global Finance for the recognition,” he said. Mr Joseph Giarraputo, Publisher and Editorial Director of Global Finance, said that the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the global transition to digital banking. “This year, a global pandemic accelerated the transition to digital banking, but forward-thinking banks were already on that road. “The Digital Bank Awards hone in on the institutions that are leading the shift toward a new world of banking,” he said. Only recently, Global Business Outlook awarded FirstMobile with the 2019 Best Mobile Banking App.
