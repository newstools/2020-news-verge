US President Donald Trump was on Friday flown to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center less than 24 hours after he was tested positive for coronavirus. The White House in a statement said the decision to transport the President to the hospital was taken “out of an abundance of caution”. Trump – who had a fever – said early on Friday he and First Lady Melania Trump had tested positive for Covid-19. The White House said he was feeling “fatigued but in good spirits” and was experiencing mild symptoms. The news comes just over a month before presidential elections, where he will face Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In a video posted to Twitter, Mr Trump said: “I want to thank everybody for the tremendous support. I’m going to Walter Reed hospital. I think I’m doing very well. “But we’re going to make sure that things work out. The first lady is doing very well. So, thank you very much, I appreciate it, I will never forget it – thank you.” The president’s children, Ivanka and Eric, retweeted his post, praising him as a “warrior”. Ms Trump added: “I love you, dad.” Upon arrival at Walter Reed, the president did not go to the emergency room for treatment, but went directly to the hospital’s presidential suite, according to the BBC’s US partner.
