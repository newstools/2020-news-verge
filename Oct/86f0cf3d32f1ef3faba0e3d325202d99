The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Mr. Sunday Dare, says the ministry will empower 20 youth living with disabilities from the North West Zone to be self reliant and discourage alms begging.  Dare said this in a statement issued by Mrs. Lere-Adams Adjobome, the Director Press in the Ministry, on Tuesday in Abuja. He said that the ministry in collaboration with governors of the seven states in the North West was organising an empowerment training programme in Kano State, to mentor and impart life enhancement skills for Youths Living With Disabilities (YLWDs). According to him, the programme, which is targeted at YLWDs from the Northern zone, is also meant to increase the level of awareness of the public to accommodate youth with disabilities aspiring to political offices. He said that the programme would also ensure their participation in economic, social and cultural activities, with equal opportunities. Dare said the programme was designed for 120 youth living with disabilities from the seven states of the North-West Geo-political zones, comprising those with physiological (functional and /or mobility impairments), visual and hearing disabilities.
