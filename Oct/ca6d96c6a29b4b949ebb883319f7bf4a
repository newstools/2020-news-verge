The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) on Wednesday reacted to social unrest following the aftermath of #EndSARS protests losing N113 billion, amid sell pressure.  Specifically, the market capitalisation shed N113 billion or 0.75 per cent to close at N14.870 trillion against N14.983 trillion recorded on Tuesday. Also, the All-Share Index dipped 216.33 points or 0.75 per cent to close at 28,449.49 compared with 28,665.82 achieved on Tuesday. Consequently, the month-to-date and year-to-date gains both moderated to 6.0 per share. Mr Ambrose Omordion, the Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd., attributed the loss to panic selloff by investors in reactions to the shooting of protesters and disruptions of economic activities. Omordion said that the development had worsened the nation’s political and economic risk that would further delay economic recovery. “The state of the nation at this point will affect local and international investors confidence in the market and the economy in general,” he said. The downtrend was impacted by losses recorded in large and medium capitalised stocks, among which are; MTN Nigeria Communications, Guinness, Lafarge Africa, Ardova and Julius Berger. Market sentiment was negative with 34 losers in contrast with four gainers. On the other hand, Royal Exchange led the losers’ chart in percentage terms by eight per cent to close at 23 kobo per share.
