The Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, has directed all Federal Tertiary Hospitals to treat casualties of civil unrests arriving their hospitals without any delay.  Ehanire gave the directive in a statement signed by the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Mr Abdullaziz Abdullahi on Thursday in Abuja. According to the Permanent Secretary, the minister considered the need for emergency medical services as a result of civic unrest in some parts of the country. “The minister considered the need and directed that casualties arriving Federal Tertiary Hospitals with evocative injuries should NOT be rejected on account of inability to pay for service. “All such persons are to receive treatment without delay. This administration places priority on the health and wellbeing of citizens and residents and is committed to assuring that lives are not lost needlessly.’’ Meanwhile, Ehanire said all persons were reminded to still adhere under all conditions to non-pharmaceutical measures in order to sustain the gains of stemming COVID-19. He said people should adhere to the use of face masks and hand sanitisers as well as physical distancing to preserve the gains made in stemming community transmission of COVID-19 in Nigeria. “Federal Ministry of Health reiterates that continuation of routine service delivery is imperative, using a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 to assure staff protection from infection, considering the ease of transmission. “Chief Executive Officers of all Federal Tertiary Hospitals are to note this directive for immediate compliance please,’’ he said.
