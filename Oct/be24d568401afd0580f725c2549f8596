The Vice President, North Star Opinion Research in the U.S., Mr. Jon McHenry, has cautioned politicians and other stakeholders against “war type rhetoric” used in politics.  McHenry made the call while briefing newsmen selected by the U.S. Department of State – Bureau of Global Public Affairs to cover the 2020 U.S. election on the topic, “Battle Electoral Ground States”. At a webinar, McHenry said that it was time to do away with statements and rhetoric that could instigate violence in a democracy. “We probably tone down all the war type rhetoric we use in our politics, it tends to raise the stakes. “It tends to lead some extremist terrorist groups to say ‘oh am a militia’ and they say they are going to kidnap a governor. “This is not where we should be headed with this language and tone in our politics,” he said. He said that some states are predominantly won by the Democratic Party while some are dominated by the Republican Party. McHenry said that some other states are referred to as battle grounds because they are not dominated by any party. According to him, politicians are likely to spend more money on campaign adverts in ‘battle ground” states to swing voting in their favour.
