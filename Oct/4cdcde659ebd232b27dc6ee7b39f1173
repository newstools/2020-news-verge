Thirty minutes into the start of Sunday, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) began the final collation of results for the Ondo governorship election. The collation, which is taking place at the INEC office at Alagbaka in Akure, brings the election which was held on Saturday closer to its conclusion. According to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), 17 parties are on the ballot, although some have collapsed their structures to campaign for others. Incumbent Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu of the All Progressives Congress is also seeking re-election but is expected to face stiff competition from the Peoples Democratic Party’s Eyitayo Jegede and the Zenith Labour Party’s Agboola Ajayi.
