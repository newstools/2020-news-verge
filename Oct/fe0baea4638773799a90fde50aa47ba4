Gov. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has directed that Friday, Oct. 9, be observed as a work-free day for state workers to enable preparations for the election on Saturday.  Mr Donald Ojogo, Commissioner for Information and Orientation, in a statement on Thursday in Akure said the decision was became necessary in view of the fact that some people will have to travel to their home towns for the election. According to Ojogo, Friday is specifically approved as such to enable workers to have enough time to embark on adequate measures aimed at preparing themselves for the election. “This includes necessary trips by workers to areas where they are registered to cast their votes. “Eligible voters are advised to be law abiding throughout the period of the exercise. “They are equally encouraged to take maximum advantage of the adequate security measures already put in place to exercise their voting rights without any fear of harassment, intimidation and molestation. “Governor Akeredolu wishes all stakeholders, especially our workers in the public service, the best of luck as they exercise their civic responsibility,” the commissioner said.
