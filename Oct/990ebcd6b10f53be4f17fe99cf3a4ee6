Mr Wadata Bodinga, Director, Vehicle Inspection Office (VIO), Abuja, has urged Nigerians to use the agency’s self service centres for vehicle papers registration and renewal and stop going through touts and agents.  Bodinga told our reporter on Tuesday that the agency’s self -service system: www.selfservice.drts.gov.ng eliminates physical contacts. “This measure was put in place to eradicate contacts not just with fake agents, but also with our staff by giving direct access to the general public to now do things on their own. “You can renew your vehicle particulars and even pay for your fines at anytime, anywhere with just a click on your mobile phone handset, laptop or i-Pad. “All you need to do is to have data on your device, log on to the service address and follow the instructions to the end. “When you do this, you have the confidence that you are paying directly to the government. “By so doing, it is optional if you decide to seek the assistance of either touts or agents or whosoever, but an easier, more reliable option has been made available,” he stressed. He urged the general public to contact the agency’s Public Relations Office on telephone numbers 07000 2285 2846, 0704 7008 000 or 0818 888 9913 for further enquiries. The VIO is also known as the Directorate of Road Traffic Services (DRTS).
