The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) on Thursday said that hurricane Delta has re-strengthened into a Category 2 storm in the Gulf of Mexico and could become a major hurricane by Friday.  The Miami-based weather forecaster said about 485 miles (780 km) south-southeast of Cameron, Louisiana with maximum sustained winds of 100 miles (155 km) per hour, the hurricane will move over the central Gulf of Mexico later on Thursday. NHC said the hurricane was projected to move inland on the U.S. Gulf coast by Friday night, warning of life-threatening storm surges along portions of the northern Gulf coast.
