Full-back Jordi Alba has picked up a hamstring injury, FC Barcelona said on Monday, raising doubts about his availability for the Clasico meeting with Real Madrid later this month.  Barca did not say how long Alba, who was not called up by Spain for their upcoming triple-header, will be missing. But local media reported it was likely to be at least three weeks. “Tests carried out this (Monday) morning have confirmed that Jordi Alba has a muscular injury in his right hamstring. “He is out and his recovery will determine his availability,” the club said on social media. Alba was forced off in the second half of Barca’s 1-1 draw at home to Sevilla on Sunday, with new signing Sergino Dest replacing him.
