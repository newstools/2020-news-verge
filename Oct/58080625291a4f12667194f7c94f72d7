A Chinese mainland spokesperson on Tuesday voiced firm opposition to U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.  Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks when asked about the U.S. government’s approval. The U.S. plans to sell weapons worth about 2.37 billion U.S. dollars to Taiwan. Zhu said that the U.S. government has repeatedly sold arms to China’s Taiwan region, sending wrong signals to Taiwan independence forces. She said that this was a violation of the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiques, especially the Aug. 17 Communique. “We firmly oppose such acts,’’ she added. The Democratic Progressive Party authority in Taiwan has been stubbornly counting on military force to seek Taiwan independence, Zhu said. She added that such attempts would only undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and bring disaster to people in the region.
