China has decided to impose sanctions on relevant U.S. enterprises involved in the latest arms sales to Taiwan and individuals, entities playing a “vile role” in the process.  China said it was a “necessary steps” to protect its national interests. Zhao Lijian, a foreign ministry spokesperson made the remarks at a daily press briefing when responding to a related query. The U.S. companies concerned include Lockheed Martin, Boeing Defence and Raytheon. Zhao said, as pointed out by China on many occasions, the U.S. arms sales to Taiwan seriously violate the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. Joint Communiques, as well as undermine China’s sovereignty and security interests. “We stand firmly opposed to and deplore such practice,’’ the spokesperson said. China once again urges the U.S. side to abide by its commitment to the one-China principle and provisions of the three China-U.S. joint communique as well as cease arms sales to Taiwan and any military contact with the island, Zhao said. “We will continue to take necessary measures to safeguard our national sovereignty and security interests,’’ the spokesperson added. Earlier, the Chinese Foreign Ministry vowed an appropriate and necessary response in accordance with the developments of the situation, after the U.S. had approved planned arms sales to Taiwan worth about $1.8 billion.
