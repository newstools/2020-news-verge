The Disability Right Advocacy Centre (DRAC), a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), has called for holistic approach to protect the sexual and reproductive health rights of Persons Living With Disability (PWD).  The Executive Director of DRAC, Mrs Irene Ogbogo, gave the advice in her address at a three-day training workshop on “Disability Innovation Laboratory” held in Abuja. She said that the workshop was designed to promote the sexual and reproductive health rights of women and girls living with disability. According to her, the aim is to tackle challenges that hinder women and girls with disability from accessing sexual and reproductive health services. Ogbogo added that the focus on women and girls was because they were vulnerable and often face challenges about their rights, especially those living with disabilities. The director said “the main challenge had been the lack of access by women and girls with disability to enjoy sexual and reproductive health services. “Women and girls living with disability are being raped, abused and nobody tend to believe them when the issue is raised. “So, we decided to gather young innovators and social entrepreneurs, particularly those who work in health related fields, to achieve meaningful growth.” Furthermore, she urged persons living with disabilities to always imbibe modern skills in technology to ensure better future for themselves. “This has become important for them to improve their lives and also come up with new ideas on ways to tackle challenges that surround health service delivery. “The world has gone digital; so we feel technology and innovation are key to promoting the health rights of people living with disabilities.”
