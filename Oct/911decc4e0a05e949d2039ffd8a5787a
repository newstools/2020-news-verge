A Federal High Court in Ibadan on Wednesday sentenced a Tunde Fatai, 19, to seven months imprisonment for trafficking 12.32g of cocaine.  Justice Patricia Ajoku sentenced Fatai after he pleaded guilty to trafficking in hard drugs. Ajoku held that she had no option than to sentence Fatai based on his plea and overwhelming evidence before the court. “This judgment is in consideration of Section 270 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) 2015 which provides for anyone who pleads guilty to be given a reduced sentence. “In addition, Fatai is a first time offender and has shown enough remorse to turn a new leaf. “He is hereby sentenced to seven months imprisonment from Sept. 10 when he was first arrested,” she said. The defence counsel, Mr Musbau Olapade, prayed the court to temper justice with mercy in sentencing his client. Earlier, Mr Raphael Himinkaiye, prosecution counsel for the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Oyo State Command, told the court that the convict committed the crime on Sept. 10, at the arp Corner, Oluyole Local Government, in Ibadan, Oyo State. He said that Fatai was arrested with a sack containing 12.32 grams of the illicit substance. The prosecutor said that the offence contravened the provisions of Section 11 (C ) of the NDLEA Act Cap N30 of THE Law of Federation 2004.
