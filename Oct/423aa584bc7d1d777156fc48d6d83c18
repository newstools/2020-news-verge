Long queues have resurfaced in most filling stations in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.  Our correspondent reports that most filling stations along the Kubwa Expressway were filled with motorists trying to buy Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), also known as petrol. Some of the petrol stations that recorded the queues are Shema Filling Station, AA Ranonoil, Conoil, Mobil, Dan oil PLC and the Nigerian National petroleum Corporation (NNPC) filling stations, all located along the Kubwa expressway. Some of the motorists who spoke to NAN said they just noticed the long queues and decided to top up. Also speaking, a taxi driver who identified himself only as Moses, said he had to buy fuel to be able to do his businesses, in case there is scarcity. “I did not have in mind to buy petrol, but seeing queues in two filling stations and coming down, the same thing is happening. I have to do something. “I just have to buy now with the small money that I have, to get ready for Tuesday’s work.
