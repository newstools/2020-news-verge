Pandemonium has broken out in the Lekki Toll Gate Area of Lagos State as armed security personnel stormed the scene of the #EndSARS protests and opened fire at them. While details of the incident are still sketchy, there have been reports of various casualties, with many sustaining gunshot wounds. Some videos from eyewitnesses at the scene of the incident have shown some persons bleeding seriously, while others tried to extract the bullets. Others were seen administering CPR to some injured persons, to resuscitate them. The incident comes hours after the Lagos State Government declared a 24-hour curfew as part of efforts to stop the violence which had broken out in some parts of the state by criminal elements who have been hijacking the protests. Although the curfew was to commence at 4:00 pm, many were still seen protesting across the state. At the Lekki Toll Gate which has been one of the major converging points of the protests, peaceful and unarmed protesters were still seen gathered in large numbers around 5:00 pm, an hour after the curfew was to have commenced. The situation, however, took a turn for the worse around 7:00 pm when the security operatives stormed the area.
