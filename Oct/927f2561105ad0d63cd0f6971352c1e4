Dr Aisha Mohammed, Wife of the Bauchi state Governor, on Monday donated food items to not fewer than 100 Orphans and Vulnerable Children in Bauchi to celebrate the 62nd birthday anniversary of Gov. Bala Mohammed.  The exercise which was held in Bauchi had beneficiaries drawn from all the 20 Local Government Councils. Our correspondent reported that the first lady also told the children to be vigilant and report all forms of gender- and Sexual-based violence. “Report any person who touches your body, be it uncle, neighbour or stranger or even those who lure you by giving you sweets or gifts to your parents,” she said. She also advised parents to remain liberal for their children. While holding a prayer session with the children, Dr. Mohammed called for more prayers for Nigerian leaders to enable them embark on meaningful development. Ms Mary James and Ms Amina Babaji, on behalf of the beneficiaries, appreciated the first lady and prayed for a healthy and blissful life for Gov. Mohammed as he celebrated his birthday.
