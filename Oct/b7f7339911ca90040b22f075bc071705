A Grade I Area Court in Kubwa, Abuja, on Tuesday sentenced a 41-year-old trader, Adams Bala, to four months imprisonment for receiving stolen “burglar proof” and metal doors.  The Judge, Muhammad Adamu, sentenced Bala who lives in Byazhin Kubwa, Abuja, after he pleaded guilty and begged the court for leniency. He also gave Bala an option to pay a fine of N5, 000. Adamu also ordered the police to return the recovered stolen property to the rightful owner. He, however, warned Bala to desist from committing crimes. Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Babajide Olanipekun told the court that the complainant Olafisoye Dotun reported the matter at the Divisional Police Headquarters, Byazhin on Sept. 30. Olanipekun said Bala was caught by the community security guards in Byazhin in possession of two iron doors and burglary proof suspected to be stolen. The offence, he said, contravened the provisions of Section 319 of the Penal Code.
