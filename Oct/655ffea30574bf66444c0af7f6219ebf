The Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said during a media briefing at Lagos House, Marina, that nobody, except essential service providers and first responders must be found on the streets. “Dear Lagosians, I have watched with shock how what began as a peaceful #EndSARS protest has degenerated into a monster that is threatening the well-being of our society. “Lives and limbs have been lost as criminals and miscreants are now hiding under the umbrella of these protests to unleash mayhem on our State. “As a government that is alive to its responsibility and has shown a commitment to the movement #ENDSARS, we will not watch and allow anarchy in our dear state. “I, therefore, hereby impose a 24-hour curfew on all parts of the State as from 4pm today, 20th October,2020. “Nobody, except essential service providers and first responders must be found on the streets,´´ Sanwo-Olu said.
