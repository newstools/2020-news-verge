Kano Hydro and Energy Company (KHEDCO), says the construction work on 7.2MW Tiga Hydroelectric Power Station will be completed in December.  The company also said the Tiga project had reached about 95 per cent completion stage while the 6MW Challawa Goje Hydroelectric project was at the excavation stage and expected to be completed by 2021. Alhaji Abba Muhammad, the Head of Administration of the company, disclosed this in an interview with our correspondent, on Wednesday in Kano. It was reported that KHEDCO was established in 2016 under the Kano Independent Power Project (IPP), to encourage development of alternative sources of energy to enhance electricity generation through effective utilisation of water resources in the state. Muhammad disclosed that the company had obtained generation/transmission and other related licences for the 7.2MW Tiga and 6MW Challawa Goje hydropower projects as well as an injection substation in Panshekara area of Kano metropolis. “We are working to provide renewable energies such as thermal power using selected oragnic waste and solar plants in the state. “This will reduce the level of organic waste, provide job opportunities for the youths and enhance power generation from hydro plants. “Our target is to boost energy supply to the state from the national grid, reduce cost of running generators in Challawa and Tambarawa water works as well as the Kano metropolitan street lighting system,” he said. Muhammad commended the state government for the support towards actualising the IPP projects designed to boost water and power supply in the state.
