Alphabet Inc’s Google said on Friday it was introducing new features across its search engine, Maps and voice assistant to help voters in the U.S. find their nearest voting locations.  “Details on in-person voting or returning mail-in ballots can be found under searches with early voting locations or ballot drop boxes near me,” Google said. It added that the data was pulled from a joint project between state election officials and non-partisan, non-profit civic group, Democracy Works. Google said its voice assistant would also share details on where to vote nearby, if prompted with the question, while Google Maps would provide directions and voting hours for the locations.
