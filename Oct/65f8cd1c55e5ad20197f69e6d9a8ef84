The central German city of Erfurt has cancelled its Christmas market this year due to the coronavirus situation, it announced on Sunday after a crisis meeting.  The cancellation is part of a new general decree that the city plans to publish on its website on Monday and which will apply until Nov. 30. “The infection situation in the city leaves us no other choice,’’ Mayor Andreas Bausewein said, explaining the decision. Restaurants and bars will be under curfew between 11 p.m and 5 a.m., and the sale of alcoholic beverages will be banned during this time. Cultural events in closed rooms are to be limited to a maximum of 25 people, and in the open air to 100 people. All festivals or dance events including the St Martin’s Day festival and the Christmas market are prohibited. Erfurt has been designated a coronavirus risk area since Saturday. Private and family celebrations will be limited to a maximum of 10 people and they may not come from more than two households. Sports events may only take place without an audience, and mouth and nose coverings will be mandatory at political and religious events.
