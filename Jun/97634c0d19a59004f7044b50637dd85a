Gov. Mai Mala Buni of Yobe has expressed sadness over the unfortunate loss of a life, injuries and damage caused by rainstorm accompanied with powerful winds in Damaturu.  It was reported that there was downpour in different areas of Damaturu on Monday that led to the loss of a life and the destruction of property. Buni in a statement in Damaturu through his Director General, Press and Media Affairs, Mr Mamman Mohammed, prayed for the repose of the soul that was lost in the storm and, to his family; the fortitude to bear the loss. He also prayed for quick recovery for those who sustained injuries. He directed the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) to ensure the treatment of all those injured and assess the level of damage for provision of assistance to the victims. He also directed the Yobe State Environmental Protection Agency to evacuate all drainage systems to ensure free flow of rain water as the rainy season starts. Buni also urged the people to support the state government in the evacuation of the drains and cautioned against converting the drains into refuse dumps. He warned against construction of structures on water ways, urging the communities to monitor and report illegal structures blocking free flow of rain water in their areas to relevant government agencies.
