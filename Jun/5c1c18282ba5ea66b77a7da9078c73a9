The Civil Liberties Organisation (CLO), an NGO, has appealed to the Federal Government to introduce scholarships to the highest scoring candidate in the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB’s).  The CLO Chairman in Anambra, Mr Vincent Ezekwueme, made the call on Wednesday while speaking with our reporter in Enugu. Ezekwueme said that such move would motivate more Nigerian students and youths to take their study and reading more seriously and put in their best. He, however, noted that the two best JAMB candidates both male and female were from Anambra. “CLO pleads with President Muhammadu Buhari to award scholarship to Miss Agnes Maduafokwa and Master David Nwobi, who took first and second positions respectively in just released JAMB examination results. “The outstanding and remarkable performances of the students deserved commendation, emulation and appreciation.” “It is of prime importance to note that such award from our dear President will encourage hard work, motivate and influence other students.” “The award, when given, will also inculcate in students and youths virtues of hardworking and voracious reading because rewards for hard work is success and fulfilling one’s life potentials,” the chairman said. Ezekwueme noted that the two candidates had brought respect, honour, glory and goodwill to the government and people of Anambra. It was reported that it is on record that in 2019, Anambra won four laurels out of 24 contested during the Presidential Awards Organised by the Federal Ministry of Education.
