A High court 2 sitting in Anambra state, today remanded the former President General of Isuaniocha, Awka North local government area, Chief Anthony Onyeagolu and one other in police custody following an alleged murder of Mr Angus Okoye, a deputy youth leader in the community. Justice Charles Okaa of Court 2, Anambra state High Court, Awka Division equally remanded him and one of his hitman, Moses Emebo in the police custody over the murder of Okoye, and adjourned the case to July 13, 2020. They were arraigned in a charge No. A/25c/ 2020, IGP vs Chief Anthony Onyeagolu & other. It will be recalled that the deceased family nd indeed the entire Isuaniocha community have been crying for justice on the gruesome murder of their son on 16/12/2018 after being kidnapped on 15/12/2018 in his home, Ifite-Isu village by the suspects. It will also be recalled that the same suspects were earlier arraigned on 1/6/2020 at high court 5 before Hon. Justice Ezeoke who earlier denied them bail on the attempted murder case of Chidiebele Okoye on 18/11/18 who miraculously survived the murder attempt when he was presumed dead by the assailants before they proceeded to eliminate Angus Okoye a month later. The case was also adjourned till 16/6/20 for proper arraignment and further hearing on the matter. The deceased family and indeed Isuaniocha community who attended the celebrated murder case arraignment en masse were full of joy and appreciation even though in grief to the Honourable court and Anambra State judiciary for taking a bold step in dispensing justice without minding whose ox is gored. The same appreciation goes to the CP Anambra State and the DIG FCID for the long expected arraignment to make sure that justice is done after one year of lingering investigation. This is a great relief for the family to bury their deceased brother to rest in perfect peace.
