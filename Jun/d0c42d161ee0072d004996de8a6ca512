Sen. Nicholas Tofowomo (PDP-Ondo) has formally welcomed the state Deputy Governor, Mr Agboola Ajayi to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).  It was reported that Ajayi on June 21 decamped from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to PDP and received his PDP membership card at his Apoi Ward 2 in Ese Odo Local Government Area (LGA) of the state. Tofowomo in a statement by his media aide, Mr Olumide Akinrinlola on Tuesday in Okitipupa said that the deputy governor has joined the moving train of PDP from the APC. “Let me join my voice in welcoming the state deputy governor, Mr Agboola Ajayi into the moving train of the PDP from the APC,” he said. Tofowomo commended the national leadership of PDP under Prince Uche Secondus for providing a level plain ground to all governorship aspirants in the state ahead of the party’s primaries. “As a Senator of the Federal Republic, I owe it a responsibility to commend the national leadership of PDP under Secondus, over its commitment to provide a level plain ground to all the governorship aspirants for the primaries. ”There is no doubt that the statement made by Secondus during the reception of the deputy governor into our party, has cleared the air over unnecessary insinuation about a possible automatic ticket,” Tofowomo said.
