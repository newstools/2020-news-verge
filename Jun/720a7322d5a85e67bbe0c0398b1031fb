The Speaker, Lagos State House of Assembly, Mr Mudashiru Obasa, has commiserated with the family of Sen. Bayo Osinowo who died at age of 64.  Obasa, in a condolences message in Lagos on Monday, said that Lagos Assembly had lost a political stabilizer. It was reported that the late Sen. Osinowo was a four-term member of Lagos House of Assembly, representing Kosofe Constituency I, before moving on to National Assembly. The speaker said that the late politician helped many to resolve their socio-political problems because of the sagacity and wisdom he applied to issues. Obasa said the death of Osinowo, who representated Lagos East in the Senate, had come as a rude shock many in the Lagos House of Assembly were yet to recover from. “Not many could believe that the ebullient and ever-smiling Pepperito, like a candle in the wind, had been blown out. “Even with the evidence that death has done its worst, it is still difficult to come to terms that a political pillar and peacemaker is gone. “For the 16 years (2003- 2019) he was in the Lagos State House of Assembly representing the good people of Kosofe Constituency 1, many loved him for the stabilising role he played at every point in the period. “Throughout his stay in the House, many ran to him for solutions to their socio-political problems because of the sagacity and wisdom he applied to issues,” he said. Obasa said the Lagos Assembly Muslim community would forever be grateful for his fatherly role and financial commitment to the building of the ultra-modern mosque within the assembly complex.
