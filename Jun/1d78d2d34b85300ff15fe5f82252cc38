The management of Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) on Saturday said contractors, who engaged the sweepers were responsible for their upkeeps.  The Acting Managing Director of LAWMA, Mr Ibrahim Odumboni, made the clarification on Saturday in Lagos. Odumboni was reacting to the recent protests by some of the street sweepers over non-payment of their monthly salaries and general welfare. He said the agency was ensuring that the government of Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu achieved its aim of cleaner Lagos. The acting managing director said the sweepers were engaged by contractors and they should be responsible for their upkeeps. Odumboni said, in spite of this, the state government prioritises the cleaners’ welfare and wellbeing, hence, they were given adequate care, supports and protection. “LAWMA has made the April payments to our sweeping contractors for onward disbursement to their staff members. ”In addition, efforts are being made to ensure prompt release of subsequent payments, not only for May, but all future payments. “The authority, and indeed the state government, appreciate the great work our workers are rendering, especially during this COVID-19 pandemic period. “We, therefore, assure them that we will continue to pay optimal premium to their welfare. “We appreciate everyone who has shown concern and understanding toward our efforts in ensuring a consistent and sustainable cleaner Lagos,” Odumboni said.
