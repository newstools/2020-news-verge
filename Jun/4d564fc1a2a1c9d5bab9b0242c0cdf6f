The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) and Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) are partnering to ensure that all agencies of government at the airports work together to facilitate ease and seamless passenger clearance without compromising National Security.  The Service Public Relations Officer, Mr Sunday James disclosed this in a statement made available to our reporter on Thursday in Abuja. James said that NIS and NCAA has proposed single window border operation at the international airports to facilitate secured International travels at the airports by the deployment of an advance technology. He said that the aim of the deployment was to ensure all the agencies working at the airport operates under one umbrella to remove undue bureaucracy and bottlenecks associated with multiple clearance of passengers by several agencies. According to him, this brought to fore the need for actualising the operation of the Advance Passenger Information System (API) at the nation’s International Airports to track passengers mobility. “This is a major tool for getting information about a passenger before arrival into the country for effective border control and management in line with the United Nation Résolution 2396, ICAO. “The International Civil Aviation Organization also supports agencies of government at the airport and government deploying the API for standard collection and gathering of data of International travelers,” he said. James said that the API would be combined with the Migration Information Data Analysis System (MIDAS) operated by the NIS at the airport for collection of information and control of entry, which was the best international practices.
