Dr Aliyu Sani, National Coordinator, Presidential Task Force (PTF) says it is insensitive for those who lost loved ones to the coronavirus to still say that the disease does not exist.  Aliyu made the remarks at the COVID-19 daily press briefing on Thursday in Abuja. The coordinator said that if some Nigerians did not know anyone, who had died from or contract COVID-19, does not mean it was unreal. “We know that this challenge must pass and we should face this headlong.” “For every case, there are thousands that we are missing.” “We must start believing in COVID-19 and protect ourselves.” “People are dying from it.” “Our numbers are increasing and we must take measures to protect ourselves,” Aliyu said. Meanwhile, the coordinator said that the PTF could not have introduced restrictions based on suspicions, adding that COVID-19 knows no race and class. He noted that no sane country would destroy its economy based on a ‘non-existing’ problem.
