Gov. Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa on Friday inaugurated a modern rice mill in Yola and said agriculture was among the top priorities of his administration.  He said the state government had begun distribution of improved agricultural inputs to farmers across the state for the 2020 rainy season farming. “Today is another milestone in the history of agricultural revolution in the state. The modern rice mill inaugurated today is among the few of its types in the North East region. “The company is going to solve the lingering problem of market outlets being experienced by rice farmers in the state and the region in particular,” Fintiri said. The governor urged well meaning citizens of the state to come home and invest in agriculture for economic growth. Earlier, Alhaji Ahmed Lawal, the Managing Director of the company, Gidan Gona Rice Mill, said the company was established to complement government’s efforts in ensuring food production and security. Lawal said the company had capacity of processing 100 tones of rice per day now and when fully operational, would supply the north east and beyond with healthy and standard rice of different varieties. “When we start full production, we expect to produce about 300 tones per day,” Lawal said. He disclosed that the company had recruited 200 youths and would recruit about 500 when it began full production. He said the company had established a unit to support rice farmers with inputs and modern farming techniques, to enable them to produce more paddy for the company, and improve their income generation.
