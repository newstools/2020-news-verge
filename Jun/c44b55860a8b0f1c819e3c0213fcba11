The Speaker, Lagos State House of Assembly, Mr Mudashiru Obasa and members of the assembly, have paid a condolence visit to the immediate family of late Bayo Osinowo at Molipa, Ijebu-Ode, Ogun.  Speaking with the family on Sunday, Obasa extolled the sterling qualities and contributions of the late politician to the growth of the Lagos Assembly, in his 16 years as a member. It was reported that Osinowo, who died on Monday, after a brief illness, was a member of the Lagos House of Assembly for 16 consecutive years, before moving to the Senate. Obasa prayed to Almighty Allah to forgive him all his sins and grant him aljannah firdaus. “I sincerely want to urge the family to take solace in the fact that the late senator was loved by many because of his benevolence and sacrifice. “I want to also inform the family that the House of Assembly will be holding a special parliamentary session in honour of Sen. Osinowo on Tuesday. “We urge the family to choose a representative that would speak on behalf of the family at the session,” he said. The speaker and the members took turns to pray for the deceased, who until his death, was the Senator representing Lagos East. Dr Tunde Osinowo, the first son of the deceased, on behalf of the family, thanked Obasa and the lawmakers for the visit. Osinowo said his father had prepared them for his demise through his talks and deeds while he was alive. He noted, however, that it was hard for them to cope with the reality of his sudden death.
