In line with the global best practices, the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) and the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) have resolved to form a synergy to implement a Single Window Border Operation (SWBO) at the nation’s international airports. The arrangement targeted at facilitating ease and seamless passengers’ clearance without compromising national security had been sealed by both the Comptroller General of NIS Muhammad Babandede, MFR and the Director General of Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority, Captain Musa Nuhu. The equipment is to be combined with the Migration Information Data Analysis System (MIDAS) being operated by the NIS for collection of information and control of entry. A statement signed by the Deputy Comptroller of NIS and the National Spokesman of the Service, DCI James Sunday on Thursday explained that it was to facilitate a secured international travels. Besides he added that given the development “all the agencies operating at the airport would operate under one umbrella to remove undue bureaucracy and bottlenecks associated with multiple clearance by several agencies for passengers. “This brought to fore the need for actualising the operation of the Advance Passenger Information System (API) to track passengers’ mobility. “It is a major tool being deployed to get information about a passenger before arrival for effective border control and management in line with the United Nation (UN) Resolution 2396, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). “It also supports agencies of government at the airport and government to deploy the API for standard collection and gathering of data of international travelers” the NIS spokesman said.
