The Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Benue, Mr John Ngbede, said the party’s overwhelming victory at the council polls on May 30 didn’t come to him as a surprise.  Ngbede disclosed this in an interview with newsmen on Monday in Makurdi. It was reported that PDP swept all the elective positions during the Saturday polls. The party won 23 Chairmanship positions out of 23. Also, it won 276 Councillorship positions out of 276. The chairman noted that the party deserved the landslide victory because it worked assiduously for it, which manifested on Saturday. “We campaigned seriously without relenting. No political party in the state campaigned apart from PDP. “We followed all the processes of election beginning with the congresses. “Some political parties did not buy forms. Even the ones that bought forms they did not campaign at all. So, what did they expect,” he queried. He also said that Benue residents voted massively for the party 8because Gov. Samuel Ortom was performing wonders for the state. “The milestones recorded by the governor went a long way in winning votes for the party. “He has completed a lot of projects which were started by his predecessor. “He also initiated new ones and some of them have been completed while others are on the verge of completion and others ongoing,” Ngbede said.
