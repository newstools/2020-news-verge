Two Ibadan-based musicians, on Friday, said that the vacuum created by the demise of Majekodunmi Fasheke, popularly known as Majek Fashek, cannot be easily filled.  The musicians, in separate interviews, told our reporter on the telephone in Ibadan, Oyo State that Fashek was an icon that everyone looked up to and emulated. A female musician, Doyinsola Olatunji, said that Fashek was a legend, who was embodied with good lyrics. She said that he was one of the best musicians to have come out of Nigeria. “Growing up, his songs were constantly been played on radios and almost in all homes. “His lyrics were very educating and to also note is his sonorous voice. “He was one passionate musician and took delight in passing out the right information through songs, and those songs are indeed evergreen. “His songs are not just songs that will be forgotten over time. “He was one of a kind musician and was true to his genre of music and his consistency can’t be quantified,’’ Olatunji said. Also, Dare Ayelabola, the Chief Executive Officer of ‘Another Level Band’ said that Fashek fought a good fight and eventually left a good legacy. Ayelabola said that it was indeed good to see that he passed on a better person. “I’m very happy that after all, he went through, he fought the good fight and a changed man before he died. “I believe he died leaving a good legacy behind for the younger generations to learn from. “He was a very good musician that produced good musicians with good lyrics. “He used happenings in the society to teach and inform through his songs,’’ Ayelabola said.
