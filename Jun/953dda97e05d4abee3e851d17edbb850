Mr Tony Aziegbemi, State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Edo, on Friday lauded Gov. Godwin Obaseki for the renovation of Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium.  Aziegbemi gave the commendation shortly after inspecting the stadium for the PDP gubernatorial primaries scheduled for June 19, and June 20, in Benin. According to him, you won’t believe that this is the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium of the past. “The PDP wants to thank him for turning the stadium around; the stadium can be compared to any other stadium in the world. “We also express the PDP immense gratitude to Gov. Godwin Obaseki for approving this newly renovated magnificent stadium as the venue of our primaries. “We will go ahead with our preparations. “We are just about 2,100 delegates, and the stadium has the capacity for 15,000 people. “So, you can see that we are going to maintain social/physical distancing among us to make sure that we maintain the COVID-19 protocols,” he said. The chairman urged all the delegates to be peaceful and law-abiding during the primaries.
