Gov. Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia has tested positive for the Coronavirus and has subsequently gone into self-isolation, the Commissioner for Information, Chief John Okiyi, has stated.  In a statement in Umuahia on Monday, Okiyi, said that the positive result came from a second sample test on the governor for COVID-19 by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). He recalled that the result of Ikpeazu’s first test by the centre on May 30 returned negative and that the result of the second test of the sample submitted on June 4 “for confirmation” came out positive. He stated: “Recall that on Saturday, May 30, Ikpeazu volunteered his sample for COVID-19 test and subsequently directed members of the state Executive Council and those of the inter-ministerial committee on COVID-19 to submit themselves for the same test. “On Thursday, June 4, the governor submitted another sample at the NCDC laboratory for confirmation and the result returned positive. “As a result, Ikpeazu has gone into isolation as required by the relevant NCDC protocols. ”The governor is being managed by a competent team of medical practitioners with a view to nursing him back to good health.” He said that the governor had therefore directed his Deputy, Ude Oko-Chukwu, “to act on his behalf, pending his full resumption of duties.” “We wish to urge all Abia residents to take the fight against COVID-19 seriously. The disease is real but not a death sentence. “Our state has the resources to manage patients back to good health,” the commissioner stated. Meanwhile, the report from NCDC on June 7, showed that Abia now has 67 new cases of the virus, bringing the total number to 85.
