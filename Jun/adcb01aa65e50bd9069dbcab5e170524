The All Progressives Congress ( APC) Edo Governorship Primary Election Committee on Monday commended the peaceful process of the direct primaries across the 18 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the state.  The committee’s Secretary, Sen. Ajibola Basiru, who made the commendation in a statement on Monday in Benin, however, advised the public to disregard purported results of the primary being displayed in the social media. According to him, voting has been concluded in some wards and few local government areas in the state while it had yet to be concluded in others and results will be announced at the state collation centre. “It has been drawn to our attention that some results are flying about in the social media and we will like to inform the general public not to take any of those results seriously. “Only authenticated results by the electoral committee at the end of the exercise will suffice. “So far the exercise has been peaceful and COVID-19 regulations compliant,” he said.
