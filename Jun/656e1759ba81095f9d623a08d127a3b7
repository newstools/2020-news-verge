Popular Nigerian-based American radio personality, Dan Foster, has died. Foster, aka Big Dawg, died on Wednesday at a Lagos medical facility, where he is receiving treatment for an illness but some unconfirmed sources said Mr. Foster died of COVID-19. Also, former host of the popular TV show, Who Wants to be a Millionaire, Frank Edoho, said a friend confirmed the news to him. “I just got off the phone, my friend Oscar confirmed that Dan Foster has passed on. This is a very very dark year. How can I overcome this unending melancholy? Rest in Peace, dear friend,” Edoho tweeted. “This is really painful,” he tweeted. In the same vein, comedian, Bovi, said, “When I moved to Lagos in November 2003, Dan Foster was one of the reasons I didn’t run back home to Delta State. I tuned into Cool Fm one morning and Dan made me love radio. Rip Big Dawg! I’m sad you left. But I’m happy your mark remains forever!” Toke Makinwa wrote, “Rest in Power Dan Foster.” Close sources in Classic FM where he worked until about three months ago also confirmed his demise. Other sources that confirmed Mr. Foster’s death Thank you @DANFOSTERRADIO you are forever in our hearts. You are missed greatly.
