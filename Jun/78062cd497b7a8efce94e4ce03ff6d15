Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to stop the movement of herdsmen from other African countries into Nigeria. This, according to him would help to curb the rate of crime attached to the Fulani-herders conflicts across the country. He made the call on Saturday during the commissioning of 25 housing units of RUGA settlement project at Dansoshiya forest, in Kiru local government of the state. “This is the first batch of the housing units of 25 out of 200 units earmarked for construction,” the governor said. According to him, the call was necessary in order to “successfully and effectively prevent the coming of herdsmen from other African countries, because they come to this country with guns and other weapons. Which flame the clash between herders and farmers.” Dansoshiya RUGA, according to the governor would serve as a nucleus of RUGA settlement project in the state. “We engaged in this project for three fundamental reasons, first and foremost is to avoid clashes between farmers and herders, secondly to avoid movement of herders which is the source of conflict and to avoid cattle rustling. “It is absolutely necessary to improve and modernise the breeding system for Fulani cattle. As it is clear that a gallon of milk is more expensive than one gallon of petrol, it is, therefore, necessary for us to utilize this great opportunity,” he said. He also promised to construct a school and hospital in the settlement, so that the people settling there could get access to good health care.
