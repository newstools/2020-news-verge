A 20-year-old man Gideon Jaja, was on Thursday brought before a Magistratesâ€™ Court in Kafanchan for alleged theft of N530,000.  Jaja was charged with housebreaking and theft, contrary to sections 332 and 270 of the Kaduna State Penal Code Law. The Police Prosecutor, Insp Esther Bishen, had told the court that one Godwin Izunna reported the matter at the station on May 25. Bishen quoted the complainant as alleging that on the same day, he went to his shop located at Katsit and discovered that it was broken into and the sum of N530, 000 was stolen. She said the complainant alleged that he strongly suspected the defendant of being the perpetrator of the act. When the charges were read to the defendant, he pleaded not guilty. The prosecutor, thereafter, prayed the court for an adjournment to enable the Police complete investigation into the matter. In his ruling, Magistrate Michael Bawa, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N100, 000 and two sureties in like sum. Bawa adjourned the matter until June 10 for further mention.
