The Corps Marshal, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Dr Boboye Oyeyemi, has warned that the partial lifting of interstate travel by the Federal Government should not be used as an excuse to engage in reckless driving and overloading by motorists.  The warning was contained in a statement by the Corps Public Education Officer, (FRSC) Mr Bisi Kazeem, made available to our reporter on Tuesday in Abuja. The corps marshal also warned against movement during the curfew hours and directed road marshals to arrest any driver without hesitation. It was reported that the Chairman, Presidential Task Force and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustapha, on Monday, announced ease on the ban on interstate movement from June 30 to July 27. Oyeyemi ordered Commanding Officers to ensure that motorists observe safety regulations and guidelines on physical distancing in the vehicle and use of face masks. According to him, it was imperative for the corps personnel to be diligent in enforcing the order in view of the rising cases of COVID-19 in the country. “This is to ensure that drivers do not take advantage of the partial lifting of the ban to abuse traffic laws and drive dangerously,” he said. Oyeyemi directed Commanding Officers to deploy adequate personnel on all routes to ensure total enforcement of restriction on inter state travels during the curfew hours. “Any motorist who contravenes the National Orders by overloading their vehicles, violating directives on inter state travels beyond curfew hours and compulsory use of face masks would be arrested,” he said. Oyeyemi called on the public to take advantage of FRSC’s numerous public relations platform to report any driver sighted violating the Presidential orders. He also advised the public to call the FRSC toll free line: 122 or the National Traffic Radio on telephone lines: 08052998090 and 09067000015 for immediate action.
