The comment of the CGI, according to DCI James, was made at the valedictory session held in honour of the retiring Deputy Comptroller General (DCG) Nurudeen Graham and Assistant Comptroller General (ACG) Tamprika Virginia Oyedeji. The CGI admonished NIS personnel to eschewed the place of “working together as a team” by being focused, committed, selfless and sincere comrades. He appreciated all the DCGs and the ACGs overseeing directorates in the agency. He noted they have all worked hard under his leadership to develop the NIS. Babandede charged the senior officers to be more committed to national course and shun mundane matters that could stand as clog in the wheel of progress. He expressed gratitude to President Muhammadu Buhari GCFR for appointing him as the 16th Comptroller General of the NIS which gave him the platform to achieve “laudable feats and successes through the officers and men of the NIS. “To whom much is given much is expected to make the nation safe and most preferred destination’ for business and investment, and also the rallying point for all the services offered to the public by the NIS” Babandede couselled.
