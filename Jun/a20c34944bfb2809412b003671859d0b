President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has expressed grief over the passing of former Oyo State Governor, Abiola Ajimobi.  Lawan said this, in a statement by his Special Adviser (Media), Mr Ola Awoniyi, on Friday in Abuja. Lawan said that Ajimobi, who once represented Oyo South Senatorial District in the Senate before he was elected to two consecutive terms as governor, would be missed by the people of Oyo and the progressives’ political family throughout Nigeria. The Senate President said Oyo would always remember him for his numerous achievements over which the people rewarded him as the first governor to be reelected in the history of the politically sophisticated state. Lawan said his death would also be felt by the ruling All Progressives Congress, especially at a time the party needed all hands to the deck to stabilise the party. “We, at the Senate, mourn Sen. Ajimobi, who also served with merit at the upper legislative chamber between 2003 and 2007 during which time he was the Deputy Senate Minority Leader,” Lawan said. Lawan expressed his condolences to the family, friends and political associates of the departed former governor and prayed for Allah to comfort them. The Senate President also prayed for the repose of Ajimobi’s soul in Aljannat firdaus.
