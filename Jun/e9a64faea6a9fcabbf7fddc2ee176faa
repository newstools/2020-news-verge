Gov. Samuel Ortom of Benue has promised to liaise with the relevant bodies to resuscitate the Ameladu Water Works.  Ortom made the promise on Tuesday at Ameladu in Gboko Local Government Area of the state after inspecting the facility. “I will liaise with the Federal Government, Development Partners and Senate Committee on Water so as to find ways of bringing the project back to life. “This huge project is a federal government project. It was initiated and completed by President Ibrahim Babangida administration in 1993. “It is a federal government project but it was handed over to the State Government. “It was meant to serve Gboko local government area and its environs. It has a capacity of 9,000 cubic metres,” he said. He further said that the decision to revive the project was borne out of the need to tackle the water needs of the people. “I cannot abandon the project. I must put it back to use,” the governor said.
