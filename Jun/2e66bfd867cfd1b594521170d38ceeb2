The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) on Wednesday said any migrant arrested flouting the law would be prosecuted according to the immigration law.  The NIS Controller General, Mr Muhammad Babandede, stated this at the Service monthly parade in Abuja, which was done in strict compliance with social and physical distancing due to COVID-19. Babandede, in a statement by the Service Spokesman, Mr Sunday James, warned that NIS would not treat any case of abuse of Immigration laws lightly. He noted that the service was doing everything possible to ensure that only regular migrants enter and reside or do approved businesses in Nigeria. According to him, amnesty window is over. Any migrant arrested flouting the law will be prosecuted according to the law. It was reported that Babandede gave instruction for compliance and communication to all the officers and men in their commands to bridge the gap created by the COVID-19 pandemic. He said this was for continuous running of the essential services rendered by the Service to the public at the airports, seaports, land border frontiers and hinterlands offices, including the Service Headquarters, Abuja.
