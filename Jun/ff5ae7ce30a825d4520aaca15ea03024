Chelsea were awarded the Women’s Super League title and Aston Villa were declared the winners of the second-tier Women’s Championship by England’s Football Association (FA) on Friday after the season was ended due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “The FA Board has reached a majority decision to decide the 2019-20 FA Women’s Super League and FA Women’s Championship on a basic point-per-game basis, with promotion and relegation determined on sporting merit,” the FA said in a statement. “As a result, the FA Board has today confirmed the decision to award the 2019-20 Barclays FA Women’s Super League title to Chelsea FC Women, and to award the 2019-20 FA Women’s Championship title to Aston Villa Women FC.” The decision to award the title on a points-per-game basis represents a blow to Manchester City. City were top of the WSL table and a point ahead of second-placed Chelsea, having played one game more than their rivals, when the season was halted in mid-March. Both teams qualified for next season’s Women’s Champions League. Bottom-placed Liverpool, whose men’s team are two wins away from securing a first top-flight crown in 30 years, will be relegated to the second-tier for the 2020-21 season. “As the 2019-20 results were expunged between Tier 3 to Tier 7 of the women’s pyramid, there will be no relegation or promotion between the FA Women’s Championship and Tier 3 this season,” the FA added.
