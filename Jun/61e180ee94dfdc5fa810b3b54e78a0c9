Gov. Simon Lalong of Plateau, has said that government would not compromise the quality of road construction and rehabilitation in the state.  The governor gave the assurance on Tuesday, while inspecting the on going rehabilitation of the 42 kilometres Longvel- Yelwa-Ajikamai- Mato junction federal road, linking four Local Government Areas of the state and Taraba. He restated his administration’s commitment to fulfil its promises of providing quality roads, hence its intervention on the federal road. “I will come in 10 days time to check the progress of this work,” the governor said. He explained that the work was being supervised by the federal and state ministries of works, to ensure quality job that met accepted standard. Lalong noted that inspite of the dwindling resources, the government would not relent in the rehabilitation of roads in the state while awaiting federal government’s input. In his remarks, Mr Pam Boatman, Commisioner for Works, assured the governor of quality job on all road projects in the state. Also, Mr Munzer Al-Jeboury, the Project Manager, Retro Contractors Nig Ltd. handling the road rehabilitation project, said many other roads in the area needed intervention. Al-Jeboury identified lack of drains as the major cause of damages to the roads. It was reported that the governor also inspected a collapsed bridge at Duankwan village in Shendam Local Government Area, where he promised that the ministry of works would assess the damage for subsequent intervention.
