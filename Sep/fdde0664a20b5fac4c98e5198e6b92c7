Unfortunately, we lost 5,000 smart card readers, but we recovered by getting the prerequisite number of card readers from the neighbouring Oyo State, and they have been delivered. “They have arrived, been charged and configured and are ready for the election on Oct.10, in Ondo State. “Importantly, we will use the Z-pads to upload results on election day real-time and we have moved those Z-pads from Edo to Ondo State for the election. “So, the same preparations that we made for Edo, we have also made for Ondo, so we are prepared for the election,” he said.
