Sule said the commission would assist the state to resolve internal disputes and ensure demarcation of boundary lines between and within local governments areas having such issues. According to the governor, the commission is also expected to establish synergy and collaboration with the National Boundary Commission, toward resolving long standing inter-state boundary disputes.

The governor directed the council to liaise with the interim administrator of the college, as well as study government views and decisions on previous panels, including the recent investigative committee. Sule further directed the council to fill all vacancies created in the management of the institution within the shortest possible time, in line with the law establishing the college.
