In another development, the House played host to national leaders of the Tricycle Owners Association of Nigeria (TOAN), led by its National President, Augustine Apeh. The speaker tasked them to engage the state Ministry of Transportation on how to carry out their operation in the state. Oluomo said that the state remained open to a robust working relationship with law abiding unions and associations in all sectors of the state’s economy. He hinted that the state already had two tricycle unions in operations. In his remarks, Apeh said that the visit was to seek partnership with the Assembly, with a view to adding more value to tricycle operations and its management in the state. He assured that the union was ready to work together with related unions in the state.
