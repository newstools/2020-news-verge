The 100 official COVID-19 cases reported by Nigerian authorities on Sunday is the country’s lowest daily figure in at least five months. The new cases were reported from 10 states only: Lagos-39 FCT-22 Kaduna-19 Oyo-7 Ebonyi-6 Edo-3 Katsina-1 Ekiti-1 Bauchi-1 Nasarawa-1. This has taken the total number of infections in the country to over 55,000, according to an update by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on Sunday night. For about two weeks, Nigeria has been reporting cases below 300, indicating a slowing of the disease in the country. Sunday’s figure also represents a decline of about 40 per cent from the 745, Nigeria’s highest daily infections, which was reported in late June. Meanwhile, health experts are cautious whether the low figures being reported of late were due to the decline in the rates of testing across the country. Collection of samples declined grossly in at least six states across the country in August, the NCDC had reported. The number of deaths from the virus has also been low. Three deaths were recorded on Saturday, dragging the total number of deaths from the virus to 1, 057.
