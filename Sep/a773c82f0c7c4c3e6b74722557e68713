The nation’s bourse sustained positive rally on Thursday with the market capitalisation increasing by N26 billion on the back of interim dividends declared by some banks.  The market capitalisation which opened at N13.282 trillion rose by N26 billion or 0.20 per cent to close at N13.308 trillion. Also, the All-Share Index grew by 51.02 points or 0.20 per cent to close at 25,511.02 against 25,460.00 recorded on Wednesday. The upturn was impacted by gains recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; MTN Nigeria Communications, Vitafoam, UACN, Zenith Bank and FCMB Group. Capital market analysts attributed the persistent growth to positioning embarked upon by investors in interim dividend paying banking stocks. They observed that the present state of the market was good for short, medium and long-term opportunities. The analysts, however, urged investors to take position in fundamentally sound and dividend paying stocks for possible capital appreciation.
