Investors at the investorâ€™s window traded the naira at N386.25 to a dollar as market turnover stood at 92.18 million dollars. However, the naira was sold at 379 to a dollar at the official Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) window. It was reported that the planned sale of foreign exchange to Bureau De Change Operators nationwide has sent panic to the camp of speculators, thus leading to the rebounding of the naira at the parallel market.
