Gov. Simon Lalong of Plateau has urged all aspirants of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for Plateau South senatorial by-election to unite and ensure the victory of the party at the general elections.  Lalong made the call on Thursday after casting his vote at the party’s primaries in Shendam. “I met with all the aspirants and I told them that it is not just about the contest but about the party that we are going to work with. “I told them that they should rally round whoever emerges as candidate because the ultimate thing is for the party to win the main election and not to create rancour. “I know that the aspirants are respected people and they will work for the victory of the party,” he said. The governor, then, announced that after the primaries, all the other candidates would serve as campaign coordinators of the candidate and lauded the party leadership for ensuring a peaceful primary election. He stated that there was no rancour, adding that such was the new spirit of APC. “Wherever we go, we monitor what is happening there and we wish other states will copy what is happening in Plateau. “I want to commend the party for all its efforts especially in respect of accommodating all the aspirants. “At the end of the day, one aspirant will emerge and all of us will market the candidate. “By God’s grace whoever emerges from this place, will be the next senator of Plateau South,” he said.
