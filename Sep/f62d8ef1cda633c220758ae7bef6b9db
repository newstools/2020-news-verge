The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has urged the Federal Government to immortalise late Emir of Zazzau and Chairman of Kaduna State Council of Chiefs, Alhaji Shehu Idris, by naming a national monument after him.  The party made the call in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan in Abuja on Tuesday. Ologbondiyan said that the PDP had been grief-stricken over the death of the highly revered Emir, describing his death as an irreparable national loss. He described the late emir as an extraordinary and exceptionally loved monarch, who served his people with utmost dedication. Ologbondiyan added that the deceased spent his life in pursuit of people’s happiness as well as the wellbeing and peaceful coexistence of all Nigerians. “The late Emir of Zazzau was a selfless leader and outstanding nationalist, who made immeasurable sacrifices in his relentless roles toward the development and stability of our dear nation. “He demonstrated that the essence of statesmanship is in employing its values to the advantage of others rather than self. “Our party calls on the federal government to take steps to further immortalise the late Emir, including naming a national monument after him,” he said. Ologbondiyan commiserated with Gov. Nasir el-Rufai and the government of Kaduna State, family of the departed Emir as well as the good people of Zazzau Emirate. He prayed the Almighty Allah to console them and grant the departed an eternal rest.
