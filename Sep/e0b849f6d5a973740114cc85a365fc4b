A non-governmental organisation, Women Arise for Change Initiative, has urged the Federal Government to intensify efforts to make life more meaningful for the citizens.  The group’s President, Dr Joe Okei-Odumakin, gave the advice in a statement on Sunday in Lagos. Okei-Odumakin expressed concern at the hardship being faced by the citizens especially with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. She appealed to the government to avoid actions or decisions that would inflict more hardship on the people. “The recent hike in the prices of petroleum products and electricity tariff are a combination of hardships. “These steps are not acceptable,” she said. Okei-Odumakin advised Nigerians to rediscover themselves and seek ways to improve their lives.
