As Nigerians mark the nation’s 60th independence anniversary, former Senate President, David Mark, has urged the political class to critically review underlying concerns believed to be aggravating agitations, ethno-religious conflicts and insecurity.  Mark, in a statement signed by Paul Mumeh, his media aide, said that such concerns included income inequalities, imbalance in the distribution of social amenities, perceived marginalisation and inadequate infrastructure. Mark stressed that the road map to development was to identify and genuinely address those ills militating against it. “Until the issues agitating Nigerians are addressed in a manner that gives every citizen security and a sense of belonging, the quest for peace, unity and development may just be a mirage,” he said. He stressed the need to bring Nigeria back to the path of rectitude and sanity, “away from the wanton profligacy and impunity”. “It is in our collective interest to support and remain steadfast to the cause of a united nation as our strength lies in our diversity,” he said. He canvassed for a united front between and amongst the people to tackle the challenges of sustained diversity and ethno-religious differences, adding that the task of a greater Nigeria was a collective responsibility. Mark urged Nigerians to refrain from any tendency that could pull the nation apart. “We must strive to be supportive of each other; whichever way we look at it – region, zone, tribe, religion – we will always see a huge advantage of staying together.” He said that democracy must be nurtured and sustained for the benefit of all. “Democratic processes may be slow, but it remains the best system of government that is not only participatory, but gives every one a sense of belonging,” he said.
