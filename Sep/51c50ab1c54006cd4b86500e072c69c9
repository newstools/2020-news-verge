Despite the daunting challenges, the Rescue Mission Initiative has pledged commitment to work with all relevant agencies to continue rescue stranded Nigerians across the globe. Not only this, the body also said, it would continue to advocate against human trafficking and other vices of irregular migration. Adefemi Sharafadin Abdus Salam, the founder of the body established in the 2017 gave the assurance during a chat with the media in Lagos. He said, the mission would do all within its powers to go against human trafficking not just in Nigeria but across several countries with its networks in order to save the future leaders from falling prey to the tricks of criminals and sexual exploiters. His words: “It is on record that we had rescued more than 400 Nigerians stranded in different countries over the years. We are ready to partner the National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) to do more. In Oman and Saudi Arabia, we have intervened on behalf of trafficked Nigerians especially women with our Arab connection because we speak their language fluently. “We recently compiled with other organization lists of over 425 Nigeria ladies stranded in Iraq out of which more than 45 ladies had been rescued while in the Middle East, we had ensured that over 330 ladies have been returned home including the ones from Dubai and Egypt.” “We have a representative in Lebanon in person of Pastor Adeyinka Omotosho that always helped us. He has been wonderful using his Celestial church to accommodate many Nigerian ladies. We are indebted to him as well as other members of Nigerian community in the country.”
