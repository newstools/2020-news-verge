UEFA will continue to allow teams to make up to five substitutions per match instead of three for the rest of this season, the Head of European soccer governing body, Aleksander Ceferin, said on Thursday.  Ceferin told a news conference that the rule would apply to the Champions League, Europa League, Nations League and the playoff ties for Euro 2020. The increase in substitutions was introduced last season to alleviate the burden of players as fixtures built up following the stoppage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Ceferin added that the finals of the 2020-2021 Nations League would be played in October 2021 with Italy, Netherlands and Poland declaring their interest in hosting the matches.
