Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria, Oyo State Chapter has joined other concerned Nigerians to condemn and call for the immediate reversal of the satanic and unacceptable increase in electricity tariffs and pump price of petroleum products in Nigeria. This was contained in a statement signed by the Oyo State Chapter Chairman of the industrial union, Comrade Balogun Babatunde (Liberty), and made available to our correspondence in Ibadan, Oyo State capital. ”We receive with rude shock the news of the increase in electricity tariffs and pump price and to us, this is an abysmal attack on the financially drained Civil Servants and Nigerian masses”, the statement added. He harped that ”its the height of insensitivity and wickedness on the part of any leader or government to inflict further pains of fuel price hike when overwhelming majority of Nigerians are already groaning in crushing poverty, spiral inflation, increased taxes, rates and levies on foodstuff, electricity tariffs, bank transactions, transportation and other social infrastructure.” He explained that ”the adverse  multiplier effects on prices of foodstuff, transportation, services, products and production, agriculture especially poultry that’s already on the danger list, cannot be overemphasized, more so, in a covid economy”. Balogun accused Buhari led Federal Government outright dishonesty, saying he has ”reversed almost all his campaign promises he and his party, APC, made voluntarily to helpless Nigerian citizens looking to him for succor  before coming to power.” ”This government has plugged Nigerians into worse hardship than any other in the history of Nigeria. For the sake of industrial peace, we urge the Buhari led Federal Government to reserve this satanic increase in electricity tariffs and pump price immediately.”
