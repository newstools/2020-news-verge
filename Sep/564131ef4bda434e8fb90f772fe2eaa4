The Journalists International Forum For Migration (JIFORM) has described the Oyo State Diaspora policy as a concept worth emulating by other states in the country. The global media body consolidating on plans to host its second annual international summit in Ibadan, the state capital on October 15, 2020 stated the position in a statement issued by the its President/Executive Director, Ajibola Abayomi at the weekend. Ajibola said interactions with the Hon Bolanle Sarumi-Aliyu, the Senior Special Assistance to Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State indicated that the state had put in place blue print to tap from diaspora resources and potentials in areas of investments and youths empowerment to better the lots of its citizens. While appreciating the governor’s aid for her interest and commitment towards ensuring the success of JIFORM summit, he applauded her diligence in ensuring that the migration policy of the governor was being implemented to the letter. “It is not in doubt that the Oyo State government had shown uncommon concern towards repatriating its indigenes stranded abroad and willing to do more by rehabilitating and reuniting them with their families. JIFORM is also aware of the state’s collaboration with the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM) on issues of migration. These gestures among other things in the making suggest that apart from being passionate, the governor has other good initiatives imbedded in his diaspora programme. “We are also impressed with the checks being put in place to curtail human trafficking by co-opting several security agencies into a strategic arrangement to make Oyo State, a no go area for human traffickers. Indeed, one is confident, that few months from now Governor Makinde’s exemplary vision to boost the state economy through diaspora initiatives being driven by his SSA and others will be a master plan to be emulated by other states.
