The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Edo on Monday urged opposition political parties in the state to stop contriving violence ahead of the Sept. 19, governorship election.  Mr Chris Nehikhare, the State Publicity Secretary of the party, who made the call in Benin at a news conference, alleged that the opposition parties were contriving violence to make room for the postponement of the election. Nehikhare said that the PDP as a major player wants the poll, which is just 12 days away, to hold. He, however, said that the PDP was happy that there had been no new attack on its members since the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, held a peace meeting with the two major actors in the election. He condemned the antics of the opposition, adding that no PDP members would want the election postponed or a state of emergency declared in Edo. Nehikhare added that the party would not derail the process nor deviate from its commitment to free, transparent and credible election. He urged the opposition to carry on with their campaigns by telling Edo people what they could do rather than plotting for a postponement of the poll.
