The Nigeria Business Forum in Ghana has lauded the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Femi Gbajabiamila, on his intervention in the trade dispute between Nigeria and Ghana.  Mr Lanre Lasisi, the Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to the Speaker, said this in a statement issued and made available to newsmen on Monday in Abuja. Lasisi said that the forum in a letter to the Speaker by its Executive Director, Amb. Oloye Fatuyi, said that Gbajabiamila’s visit to Ghana had calmed frayed nerves. He commended the speaker for the unprecedented and all-important visit to Ghana in lieu of the unease being faced by Nigerian traders in Ghana. Fatuyi, in the letter said it was worth emphasising that Gbajabiamila’s visit to Ghana conveyed his passion for Nigerians, both home and abroad. According to him, “your style of leadership is admirable and exemplary in every standard, not forgetting the highly exceptional diplomatic approach in engaging Ghanaian authorities. “Gbajabiamila’s name is written in gold as an outstanding and compassionate leader.” He, however, said that both authorities should continue their diplomatic discourse to achieve a lasting and amicable resolution to the dispute. The forum encouraged the speaker not to relent as he worked to give the Nigerian people dividends of democracy.
