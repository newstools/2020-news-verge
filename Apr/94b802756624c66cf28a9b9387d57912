A filling station belonging to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) located within Ifako-Ijaiye Local Government Area of Lagos State has been gutted by fire.  Our correspondent at the scene of the incident on Monday reports that the fire extended to some of the buildings close to the filling station. Dr Olufemi Oke-Osayintolu, the Director General, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), and men from the agency were also at the scene of the incident. Oke-Osayintolu told our correspondent that the remote nor immediate causes of the inferno could not yet be ascertained. Oke-Osanyintolu said that upon arrival at the scene, LASEMA observed that a petrol tanker inside the NNPC fuel station had caught fire, which also culminated to the spread of the fire to buildings nearby. He also confirmed that the incident started at about 1:30 p.m. on Monday, adding that efforts were ongoing by the agencyâ€™s officials, men of the Lagos State Fire Service and the Federal Fire Service to combat the inferno. Oke-Osanyintolu,however, advised the members of the public to keep away from the scene so as to allow the responders to complete their work in good time. Our correspondent also reports that, as at the time of filling in this report, efforts were still ongoing to curtail the fire.
