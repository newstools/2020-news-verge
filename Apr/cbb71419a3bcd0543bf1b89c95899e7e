The Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Gani Adams on Wednesday promised to devote the rest of his life to charity and service to humanity.  Adams, in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Mr Kehinde Aderemi, dedicated his 50th birthday to God and to the memory of those that lost their lives to the COVID-19 global pandemic. Adams will clock 50 years on Thursday. He called on governments to ensure an egalitarian society by promoting justice and social equality for the nation to progress. According to him, at this point in time, Nigerian leadership needs to inculcate the idea of putting the interests of the people first. Adams, who said that he would be focusing more on charity to the poor and the less privileged in the society, promised to continually touch the lives of the people positively. He said that Nigerians, especially, those from the Southwest, would begin to feel his impact more due to initiatives that would add values to the lives of people across the region. “I am not getting younger, attaining this glorious age is never by my power or might, it is simply by the special grace of God who has been so wonderful to me and the rest of my family. “Therefore, at 50, I think I need to do lot more in enriching the lives of poor people in the country. “As the Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, it is important to look beyond the present situation in the country and see how we can be of help to the vulnerable. “I want to impact humanity through empowerment programmes and human capacity development initiatives,” he said. Adams said he would concentrate on building skill acquisition programmes and human capacity development initiatives. “I would like to use my social networks and influence to change the narratives, particularly, in the Southwest,” he said. The Aare Ona Kakanfo said that the challenge before the leadership of the country now was the struggle for a better society.
