A Minister in Johson’s cabinet, on Monday said Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains very much in charge of the British Government in spite hospital admission.  According to the minister, Johnson will return to his Downing Street office soon. According to Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick, Johnson has been working extremely hard, leading the government and being constantly updated. Johnson, 55, was taken to hospital on Sunday for tests. He experienced persistent symptoms, 10 days after testing positive for novel coronavirus, however, his hospital admission was a precautionary step. “Obviously today he’s in hospital having the tests but he will continue to be kept informed as to what’s happening and to be in charge of the government. “I’m sure this is very frustrating for him, for somebody like Johnson who wants to be hands-on running the government from the front, but nonetheless he’s still very much in charge of the government,” Jenrick said. Britain had reported nearly 5,000 deaths from about 50,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases as of Sunday, making it one of the worst-affected countries. Government experts estimate that hundreds of thousands of people are infected. Meanwhile, many health experts had criticized the government’s slow response to the crisis, the low level of testing for the virus and the poor provision of intensive care beds, ventilators and protective equipment. However, some right-wingers in his ruling Conservatives had warned that Britain might face economic ruin unless it eased its near-lockdown soon.
