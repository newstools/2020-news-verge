The Social Democratic Party (SDP) has urged the Muslim faithful across the country to imbibe the virtue of charity during the Ramadan season.  The Acting Chairman of SDP, Chief Supo Shonibare, made the call in a statement issued on Wednesday in Abuja by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Alfa Mohammed. Shonibare said that the period of fasting called for self-discipline in knowing oneself, mastering inordinate urges and exercising self-control. According to him, the Ramadan is a season to fast and identify our deficiencies and free ourselves from them. “It is also a season to practice charity by extending love to others, sharing food and other essentials to the needy, in order to be favoured by the Almighty,” he said. Shonibare prayed Allah to be merciful and forgive every one of their sinful ways, and may the plague of Coronavirus pass over particularly during the Ramadan period. “On behalf of myself, my family and the National Executive Committee of our party, I wish all Muslims a favoured and blessed Ramadan season,” the statement said. He further enjoined all Nigerians to continue to keep safe by adhering to the lockdown directives in states and healthcare experts advice to stay free of the pandemic.
