The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has urged Nigerians to continue maintaining social distancing to avoid further spread of COVID-19 pandemic.  The Sector Commander, Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Mr Gora Wobin, gave the advice in an interview with our reporter on Tuesday in Abuja. Wobin said it was important for all Nigerians to continue to maintain social distancing to ensure that COVID-19 was completely out of the country. He said people should know that COVID-19 was real, adding that people should not doubt its existence because they were yet to see someone close to them contracting it. “Coronavirus is real. People should not think it does not exist. “It is something everyone must take serious to ensure it does not spread, and we should see to its reduction and not increment. “And, if there must be increment, it should be those who had contracted and had been treated and discharged. Issues of contacts and deaths should be decreased. “The FRSC’s advice to motorists is to maintain social distancing by carrying one passenger in front and two at the back for saloon cars and two passengers on each seat for any other vehicle,’’ he said. Wobin advised those who do morning excercises to practice social distancing as an essential way to stop the spread of COVID-19. He noted that Coronavirus was not written on anyone’s forehead, adding a carrier could have a strong immunity and might not show symptoms. “There are some people that may be carriers till the whole pandemic goes down and they may not show any symptom. “These are people who have strong immunity and they may not have symptoms within 14 days or one year. “So, whoever is standing by you should be assumed as a carrier and adjust yourself immediately. “Do your exercise at home. Stay at home, do not go out,” he said.
