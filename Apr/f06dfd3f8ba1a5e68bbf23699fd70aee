Agege Local Government Council of Lagos State says it has sealed a mosque for violating government’s order on religious gathering in the fight against spread of the coronavirus.  Alhaji Ganiyu Egunjobi, the council Chairman, said in a statement in Thursday that Agege Central Mosque, located at Balogun street, was sealed after the taskforce fumigated the area. Our correspondent reports that Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu had banned the gathering of more than 20 persons to prevent spread of the dreaded disease. According to Rotimi Sulyman, Media Aide to the Chairman, the mosque was shut down because hundreds of worshippers flouted the governor’s order during their evening prayer. “Attempts by officials of the Lagos State COVID-19 Taskforce, who arrived at the scene to enforce compliance following a tip-off, was viciously rebuffed. “A drama ensued when some of the religious youths sighted the team and became aggressive, unruly and started to attack the team. “About 300 others in the mosque rushed out chanting ‘ALLAHU AKBAR’ and joined in the attack by throwing stones at the vehicles. “All entreaties to talk to the Imam failed as the youths were persistent. The police escort rose to the occasion, stopped further attacks and ensured safety of the team,” he said. The council boss said that the shutdown became necessary to avert recurrence and serve as deterrent to other erring faith groups or worshippers. “We cannot continue to condone act capable of spreading the dreadful disease. “Even, Saudi Arabia placed restrictions on the number of people who must worship in the two holy mosques, Haram and Nabawi, and banned congregational prayers in all other mosques across the country. “Honestly, we cannot be more Roman than the Romans. We have met with the leadership of the mosque including, the Sarkin Hausawa, Musa Muhammed. ”The meeting resolved that the mosque should be closed till further notice,” the council chairman said.
