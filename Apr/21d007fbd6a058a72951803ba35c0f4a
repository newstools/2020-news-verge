Deputy Senate President, Sen. Ovie Omo-Agege (APC-Delta) says the death of Malam Abba Kyari, Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari was a big blow and rude shock to the nation.  Omo-Agege said this in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Yomi Odunuga on Saturday in Abuja. He said Nigerians must pray for Buhari for divine help in charting the way forward. Omo-Agege expressed sadness that Kyari who had been one of the President’s major pillars of support, succumbed to the Coronavirus disease. “Malam Abba Kyari was a very hardworking patriot.” “I still recall his last official statement in which he admonished us all about the Coronavirus pandemic’s virulent threat to everyone without any consideration for class, creed or place of origin.” “There is no doubt about his encompassing influence and bold imprints in the conduct of official affairs at the Presidency over the past five years.” “Sadly, his exit came at a time when the world is reeling under unprecedented challenges and at a time when his counsel is most needed.” “Clearly, such grave loss will be deeply felt by President Muhammadu Buhari and we should pray that God Almighty grants Mr President and Kyari’s family the strength to bear this irreparable loss.” “May God Almighty grant his soul eternal repose,” he said.
