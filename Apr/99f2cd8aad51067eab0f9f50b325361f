Other gainers are Eterna, Cornerstone Insurance, Nem Insurance, May & Baker, Custodian and Allied Insurance and Cutix. Mr Ambrose Omordion, the Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd., said Lafarge Africa’s loss was driven by Coronavirus news that hit the company during the period. Omordion said the worst laggard shed 40.65 per cent in a month when virus driven bear market hit the company share price ahead of its full result. He attributed Zenith Bank depreciation to price adjustment for dividend and bearish trend. Omordion said that the panic selloffs led to poor reactions to corporate earnings in March and reflected on the number of stocks that appreciated in value. On expectations in April, he said the 14 days lockdown would likely influence the market negatively.
