Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance, Sen. Solomon Adeola (APC Lagos-West) has called on Christians to continue to abide to the precautionary measures against COVID-19 and remain prayerful as they celebrate the Easter.  Adeola, in his message conveyed in a statement by his Media Adviser, Chief Kayode Odunaro on Friday in Abuja, appealed to all to exhibit the Christian virtues of sacrifice and love. He also urged all citizens to always abide in faith for a better tomorrow, as exemplified in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. According to the senator, the COVID-19 pandemic provides Nigerians the opportunity to exhibit their faith in relation to being their brother’s and sister’s keeper as scripturally endorsed. “From the much or little we have, I urge all of us to reach out, for sustenance to the poor and vulnerable in these uncertain times of lockdown, so that we all survive beyond the COVID19 pandemic with hope of a new beginning and a better future,” he said. Adeola called on Nigerians to remain hopeful and support government’s efforts in the fight against COVID-19. He said as a federal legislator, he would always do his bit in provision of palliatives for the people in need and support legislative initiatives in the interest of the people.
