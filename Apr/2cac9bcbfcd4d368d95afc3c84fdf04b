The First City Monument Bank (FCMB) has donated N2 million to the Cross River Fund Raising and Resource Mobilisation Committee as support for COVID-19 pandemic prevention and palliative.  Mrs Tina Agbor, the committee chairman, who doubles as the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), announced the receipt of the donation on Thursday in Calabar. Agbor led the committee to visit the bank’s management to further drum support for the state’s efforts against the novel coronavirus. Accompanied by the Secretary of the Committee, Dr Inyang Asibong, the chairman assured that the money would go a long way in providing succour to the needy and support the state’s mitigation efforts. “I thank the management of FCMB for its quick response. “The money will be used to cushion the effects of the lockout directive on the poor, aged and vulnerable in the state. “This is in a bid to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic,’’ she said. Meanwhile, the committee also visited the managements of EcoBank and Access Bank, who also assured the team of their coming support. Recall that the state governor, Ben Ayade, had set up a six-man fundraising and resource mobilisation committee. The committee’s mandate was to seek financial and material collaboration with governments, corporate organisations, public-spirited individuals and friends of the state to support in the fight against the pandemic and its attendant consequences.
