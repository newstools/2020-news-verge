Sen. Umaru Al-Makura, representing Nasarawa South Senatorial Zone, on Wednesday distributed 3,000 bags of rice to his constituents as palliative to cushion effect of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.  It was reported that Al-Makura, while distributing the commodity at his constituency office in Lafia, said it was in line with the laudable efforts of the federal and state government to ease the hardship on the people. According to Al-Makura, the timing of the gesture was apt in view of the partial lockdown in the zone as well as the onset of the Ramadan fast. He said that the relief item was not a largesse for everybody, but only meant for the less privileged persons in the senatorial zone. Al-Makura explained that each of the 53 wards across the Five local government areas in the senatorial zone would get 50 bags of rice. He added that councilors in the various wards and two supervisors each from his constituency office would ensure equitable distribution of the rice to deserving beneficiaries. Al-Makura said that special consideration had been given to the physical challenged in the zone in the provision of palliatives. On efforts at protecting his constituents against COVID-19, Al-Makura said he had embarked on sensitisation across the zone through his coordinators, especially on physical distancing and regular hand washing with soap and water.
