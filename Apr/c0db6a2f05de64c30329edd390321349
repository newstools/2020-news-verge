The management of Coleman Wires and Cables, Arepo, says the company is taking its operations online and shutting its offices in line with the directive on restriction of movement over the Covid-19 pandemic.  The company’s Managing Director, Mr George Onafowokan, who made the disclosure on Friday in a statement, said that it would close down its physical operations to protect its employees from the coronavirus. It was reported that Gov. Dapo Abiodun of Ogun had sought approval of the presidency to delay commencement of the state lockdown till April 3, to enable citizens stock enough foods. President Muhammadu Buhari had directed that a lockdown in Lagos State and the Federal Capital Territory, which are worst hit by Covid-19, should commence on March 30, by 11pm. He had said that Ogun, because of its closeness to Lagos, should also be affected by the lockdown. Onafowokan said that the health and well-being of employees, as well as the society at large were of utmost priority. He said that the company would start its online operations with immediate effect. “We are absolutely focused on the health and safety of our employees, families and communities as we strictly follow the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control guideline on COVID-19. “Our Lagos and Ogun offices will be closed based on the directive of government and all our operations will be managed online between 9am to 5pm daily, ” he said. The director said that the scourge of the virus had affected families, friends, businesses and way of life and therefore, commiserated with people who had been directly or indirectly affected by the virus. Onafowokan said: “As the world comes together to eradicate this pandemic, we at Coleman Wires and Cables are reaching out in love to our very valued customers. “We pray for quick recovery of those in the isolation centres all over the country and the world at large.”
