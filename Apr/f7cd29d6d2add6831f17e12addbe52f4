Journalists were on Wednesday barred from covering the arraignment of musician Azeez Fashola (a.k.a Naira Marley) and politician Gbolahan Gbadamosi before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court.  The development followed backlash by Nigerians on flouting of social distancing directives during arraignment of Nollywood actress, Funke Akindele, and her husband, Abdulrasheed Bello, on Monday. Footage of journalists clamouring to take videos clips and photos of the actress and her husband on Monday was received with backlash because the media professionals did not also observe social distancing in carrying out their duties. Fashola and Gbadamosi are among those who allegedly attended the 43rd birthday party of Akindele’s husband on April 4 at Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos State. They were arraigned for allegedly flouting the social distancing directive of the Lagos State Government by attending the party along with more than 20 other persons. Our correspondent reports that the directive forbids gathering of more than 20 people. The aim is to curb coronavirus spread. Akindele and Bello were arraigned for the same purpose. They pleaded guilty and were sentenced to 14 days community service and a fine of 100,000 each. An officer, Mr Summonu Kazeem, from Area G Police Command, who spoke with our correspondent on Wednesday, said he got an order ‘from above’ that journalists should not be allowed into the court premises. At the time of filing this report, journalists from both print and electronic media were outside the court premises.
