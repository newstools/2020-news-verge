Police in Kogi have arrested three persons suspected to be kidnappers in Okene area of the state.  DSP William Aya, Public Relations Officer of the Police Command in Kogi, said in a statement in Lokoja on Thursday that the suspects’ arrest followed a distress call received when they abducted a woman at Total area of Okene on April 17. He said that the suspects were fleeing with their victim in a Nissan Altima car with registration number Lagos CL 591 KTU when they were intercepted by operatives attached to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). Aya said that the kidnappers were intercepted while driving towards Obangede, Okehi Local Government Area. “The operatives promptly swung into action and arrested one Alabi Joseph Adeleke and rescued the victim, Hadiza Seidu,” Aya said. He listed items recovered from the suspected kidnappers to include one handset and an Altima salon car. According to him, further investigation led to the arrest of two other members of the kidnap gang – Abdulwaheed Solomon a.k.a Efosa and Bishop Eneji Cecil. All the suspects were from Adavi and Okehi Local Government Areas of the state, Aya said. “All the suspects confessed to the crime. Investigation ongoing. Suspects will be arraigned in court on completion of the investigation,” he added.
