Yes, the numbers are being thrown at us, Ghana, South Africa, and other countries but we are not playing a numbers game. “These are human beings. Before we test anyone we go through a process to ensure that is appropriate to test the persons. “We have a strategy and we will stick with that strategy and make sure we deliberately increase the number of testing while testing the right people at the right time,” it said.
