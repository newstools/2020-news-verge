Sen. Solomon Adeola (APC, Lagos- West) has partnered with Lagos State Government to provide massive food relief for 10 local government areas and 18 local council development authorities of Lagos West senatorial district.  The senator who had earlier distributed cash palliatives and personal protection equipment for constituents across the senatorial district said the last week total lockdown was critical. Adeola in a statement by his Media Adviser, Chief Kayode Odunaro on Tuesday, said that the distribution would begin immediately to the recipients. “While it is not possible for the food items to go round millions of constituents that will need them, I have directed that the distribution be targeted at those most in need of sustenance at this point,” he stated. Adeola urged his constituents to adhere to all precautionary measures rolled out by health authorities. He said just as Ebola disease was defeated, Coronavirus pandemic would also be defeated in due course. He called on constituents to always wash their hands regularly, use sanitiser on their hands and surfaces and embrace social distancing. He also urged them to imbibe the new forms of greetings and salutations without hand shaking and body contact.
