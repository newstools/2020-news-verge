Gov. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State says the safety and welfare of health workers remain the priority of his administration.  Akeredolu stated this on Wednesday in Akure while receiving over 500 face masks donated to his government by the Ondo State Directorate of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) to help curtail the spread of the disease. The governor, who was represented by his Special Adviser on Health Matters, Dr Jibayo Adeyeye, commended the NYSC for taking the initiative to support the government. He stated that his government had enhanced the hazard allowance for health workers in the state. The governor also said his administration had entered into partnership with reputable insurance companies to provide insurance cover for health workers. “Let me inform you that despite the challenges countries all over the world are facing in sourcing Personal Protective Equipment, Ondo State Government is on top of the situation and we shall stop at nothing to ensure that our health workers are adequately protected. “As a motivational measure, we have just enhanced the hazard allowance for our health workers. “We did not stop at that, we have entered into agreement with reputable insurance companies to provide life cover for those engaged to contain the novel COVID -19,” the governor said. Akeredolu further said that the state government had commenced mass production of face masks for residents of the state. Earlier, the State Coordinator of NYSC, Mrs Grace Akpabio, had disclosed that the scheme was poised to support the state government as a beneficiary of the “large heart of the governor.” Akpabio said that the scheme had mobilised members of its Skill Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development Vanguard to mass produce antiseptic hand sanitisers and face masks. She said some of the items had been donated to government hospitals as well as public institutions and corporate organisations.
