Gov. David Umahi of Ebonyi, on Friday, suspended business activities at the state capital’s two major markets; the International and Kpirikpiri markets, on Sundays.  The directive was contained in a statement signed by the Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr Uchenna Orji and made available to our correspondent. ”Both markets will not operate on Sundays till the battle against coronavirus is won,” Umahi said. He stated that the suspension was for the good of the citizens and to protect them from the scourge of the pandemic. “This measure is to allow health workers fumigate the markets every Sunday against the incursions of the dangerous disease. “All markets operators are to note and ensure compliance,” the governor said. He further called for the cooperation of all concerned on the issue, assuring the people of safety, security and promotion of public health.
