The All Progressives Congress (APC) says it is the commitment of the Federal Government to tackle crimes arising from lockdown against COVID-19 pandemic across the country.  APC National Publicity Secretary Lanre Issa-Onilu expressed this view in a statement issued in Abuja on Wednesday. He said: “The key responsibility of government remains ensuring the safety and security of lives and property of all citizens. “From the renewed and intensified Boko Haram counter-insurgency to the enhanced offensive against emerging crimes in other parts of the country, the government is committed to taking bold steps to secure the country and the citizenry. “In line with the directives of President Muhammadu Buhari during his broadcast on Monday, a major and coordinated offensive by the Police, Army, Navy, Airforce and Directorate of State Services (DSS) is underway against the miscreants.” According to him, there is no dispute about the hardships being faced by many citizens as a result of the unavoidable lockdown. “However, we must resist criminal elements trying to exploit the situation and in the process inflicting further hardships on already stressed fellow Nigerians,” the party’s spokesman said. He said that Nigerians needed to offer support and ensure that they provided as much comfort as possible for one another. “While the government and private concerns are doing their best to provide relief, we all have a responsibility to join our security services in protecting ourselves and communities from miscreants,” he said.
