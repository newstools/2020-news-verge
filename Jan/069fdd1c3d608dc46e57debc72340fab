Gov. Gboyega Oyetola of Osun has urged graduates of tertiary institutions to combine their skills with good moral standard in order to attain success in life.  Oyetola said the combination of the two virtues were necessary tools for greatness in life. The governor spoke on Tuesday at the 9th Convocation Ceremony of Fountain University, Osogbo. The governor said without good morals, success would be very difficult to attain in life, regardless of the skills one might have attained. He said quality skills and good morals were complementary instruments of success. Oyetola also urged Nigerian universities to adhere strictly to best practices in carrying out their core mandate of teaching, research and community service. “The world is waiting for you to help build a knowledge, technology and morally compliant society. “Your ability to attain this is what will continue to make your university and education relevant. “Do not disappoint the world and do not let down your alma mater,” the governor said. Earlier in his remarks, the Chancellor of the University, Dr Umaru Abdul-Mutallab, said as a faith-based university, Fountain University had a duty of nurturing and sustaining a life-long interest in the acquisition and cultivation of Islamic ethics and values. Abdul-Mutallab described his recent appointment as Chancellor of the university as a privilege and a call to service. He urged the graduands to be good ambassadors of the university.
