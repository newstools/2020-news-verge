The Ekiti Government has purchased 2, 000 Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) forms for candidates in the state seeking admissions into tertiary institutions in the country.  It was reported that the wife of Ekiti governor, Mrs Bisi Fayemi, disclosed this on Thursday at the flag-off of the distribution of the free JAMB forms and E-Registration Pins at Olaoluwa Muslim College in Ado-Ekiti. Fayemi assured the beneficiaries of the state government’s readiness to make education in Ekiti accessible to all and sundry She said that the gesture was in furtherance of Gov. Kayode Fayemi’s resolve to revitalise education in Ekiti and to take the sector to greater heights. The governor’s wife said that the government was committed to strengthening education at all levels so that the less privileged would have a feel of governance. She said that a total of N14 million was expended on the purchase of the forms and urged the students to make judicious use of the opportunity given to them by studying hard to ensure that they excelled. ”The youths are the leaders of tomorrow whose efforts at being leaders begin today, I therefore urge that this exercise be taken with utmost seriousness,” the governor’s wife said. She also urged the parents and guardians of beneficiaries to encourage and support their wards in ensuring that they studied hard to justify government‘s support. Earlier, the Commissioner of Education, Science and Technology, Mr Folunsho Daramola, said that the beneficiaries included indigent youths and other categories of students from the 16 local government areas of the state. He advised beneficiaries to maximise the opportunity and to apply themselves to relevant materials in the syllabus in order to perform well in the examination.
