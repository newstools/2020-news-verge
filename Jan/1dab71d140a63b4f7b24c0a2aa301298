The Federal High Court, Abuja, on Monday, again failed to deliver ruling on Abdulrasheed Maina, ex-chairman, defunct Pension Reformed Task Team (PRTT)’s application for variation of his bail conditions.  Justice Okon Abang, who made this known during the proceeding, attributed the reason to heavy workload on the court. The judge, who said the ruling was still within time, said it would be deliver on on Jan. 28. “The matter was adjourned till today for ruling on the application for variation of bail conditions and for continuation of trial. “The said ruling is still not ready on account of heavy workload on the court. But the court is still within time to deliver ruling on thr application. “The court shall tomorrow by 10 a.m. deliver the ruling God willing,” he held. Our correspondent reports that Justice Abang had, on Jan. 23, unable to rule on the bail variation plea by Maina. The judge had also said that though the ruling was not ready, it was still within time. Recall that Justice Abang had, on Dec. 18, 2019, adjourned the hearing on the bail variation application till Jan. 13. On Jan. 13, Justice Abang again adjourned the hearing till Jan. 14 and after the proceeding, he adjourned to deliver ruling on the matter on Jan. 23. Justice Abang had, on Nov. 25, admitted Abdulrasheed Maina to a bail in the sum of N1 billion. The judge, who gave the ruling, also ordered that Maina must produce two sureties who must be serving senators. The two lawmakers, according to the judge, must not be standing any criminal trial in any court in the country and must have landed property at Maitama or Asokoro area of Abuja. He also ruled that the two sureties, who must be prepared for a N500 million bond each, must always be in court with the defendant at each adjourned date. However, Maina had been unable to meet the bail conditions.
