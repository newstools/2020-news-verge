The Lagos State PDP Chairman, Mr Adedeji Doherty, on Tuesday urged President Mohammadu Buhari to leave a legacy of one man, one vote to deepen democratic experience in the country.  Addressing a news conference on the recent Supreme Court judgments on the 2019 governorship elections, Doherty stressed the need for the present administration to leave a legacy of one man, one vote before exiting power in 2023. According to the PDP chairman, leaving the legacy of a good voting pattern in the country will deepen the nation’s democratic experience. He advised Nigerians, especially his party members, to be law abiding in their reactions to the recent judgments by the apex court. “We call on the Nigerian people to be law abiding. Let us pray that our leaders will see reasons to pass the Electoral Amendment Bill into Law,” Doherty said. The PDP leader said it was common knowledge that the Supreme Court could not change the judgment it had passed. “We have come to the Lagos State Judiciary to present to the Chief Judge our petition against the Supreme Court Judgment,” Doherty said. He enjoined Muslims, Christians and traditional worshipers to set aside few days to pray for the peace and progress of the country. It was reported that party faithful held a peaceful protest which began from the PDP Secretariat and ended at the Lagos State High Court, Ikeja.
