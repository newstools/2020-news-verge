NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has called an urgent meeting of the military alliance’s North Atlantic Council on Monday in response to growing tensions in the Middle East.  The ambassador-level meeting of the alliance’s main decision-making body will address the situation in Iraq after the killing of Iranian top general Ghassem Soleimani by the U.S. military, a spokesman told dpa in Brussels on Sunday. The ambassadors of the North Atlantic Council usually meet once a week, while its foreign and defence ministers meet around twice a year. The meeting is scheduled for Monday at 3 pm (1400 GMT).
