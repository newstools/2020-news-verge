Britain’s Prince Harry attended a summit for leaders of 21 African countries in London hosted by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday, the day after he spoke of his sadness that he would shortly be giving up royal duties. Harry said on Sunday that there was no option but for him and his American wife Meghan to step back from their royal roles in a deal with his grandmother Queen Elizabeth and senior Windsors that would allow them a more independent future. The new arrangement, which will see them split their time between Britain and North America where they will be mainly based, is due to come into effect in the Spring of this year. In the meantime, Harry will continue with official duties and on Monday met the presidents of Malawi and Mozambique and the prime minister of Morocco at the African investment summit. Buckingham Palace said the prince, who visited Malawi and other African states last October in what is set to be his last official overseas tour, has been heavily involved in causes in Africa for many years and his love for the continent was well-known. His high-profile speech on Sunday was made at an event for Sentebale, a charity he co-founded which helps children affected by HIV in Africa. At the summit, Johnson called for deeper investment ties between Britain and Africa, as part of a drive to develop trade ties after the United Kingdom leaves the European Union at the end of the month. Johnson called for Britain to be the “investment partner of choice” for Africa.
