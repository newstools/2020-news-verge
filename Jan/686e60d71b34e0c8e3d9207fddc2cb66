The Publisher of the newspaper, Mr Cletus Akwaya, disclosed this when he led his management team on courtesy visit to the Army Headquarters in Abuja on Friday. Akwaya said that the award was in recognition of the many achievements of Nigerian army under the leadership of Buratai ranging from successes recorded in counter insurgency operations to infrastructure development.
