The Nigerian equities market on Tuesday extended bearish stance, dropping further by 0.59 per cent with a loss of 0.59 per cent.  Specifically, the market capitalisation lost N90 billion or 0.59 per cent to close at N15.132 trillion compared with N15.222 trillion achieved on Monday. In the same vein, the All-Share Index (ASI), which opened at 29,552.99, lost 174.36 points or 0.59 per cent to 29,378.63. The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are: Total, Flour Mills, Guaranty Trust Bank, Stanbic IBTC Holdings and GlaxoSmithKline Consumer. Commenting on the market performance, Mr Ambrose Omordion, the Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd., attributed the mixed performance to profit taking. “We expect the mixed performance to continue in the midst of profit-taking and positioning by investors taking advantage of the pullbacks,” Omordion said. He said that some players were still interpreting and analysing the impact of the recent Cash Reserve Ratio adjustment, ahead of the full-year earnings reporting season. According to him, this is also against the backdrop that capital wave in the financial market may change in the midst of the unstable economic outlook for 2020.
