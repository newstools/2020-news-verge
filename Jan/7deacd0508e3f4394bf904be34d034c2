Concerned PDP Stakeholders Forum in Katsina State has urged the party’s National Working Committee to dissolve the state leadership and constitute a caretaker committee to save the party from total destruction.  This is contained in a statement issued by Mr AbdulAziz Halliru Kafin-soli on Monday in Katsina. “The caretaker committee should be given six months reconciliation period within which to reconcile all members who have been maligned by the current leadership of the party. “The caretaker committee will then conduct credible congresses leading to the election of new leadership of the party in the state. “This will give the teeming supporters of PDP in the state an opportunity to elect leaders of their choices at various levels to re-ensure confidence of our members. “We also call on the National Working Committee to immediately order a forensic audit of the books of account of the party as we believed that no organisation can survive without accountability. “The NWC should make available to all PDP members what was given to the party in terms of assistance over the years particularly during the 2019 elections. “We call on the National Working Committee to act to save the party, as it is on its way to total destruction in the state,” he said. The group alleged that majority of the members of the State’s Elders and Caucus Committees were not involved virtually in all the party activities during the 2019 general elections, which led to the party’s defeat. “The woeful failure of PDP during the 2019 general elections in Katsina State was generally believed to have been caused by the shoddy manner the state Chairman, who is also the deputy gubernatorial candidate of the party handled the entire process,” he said. However, the state PDP Chairman, Alhaji Salisu Majigiri, declined comments, as he refused to answer mobile phone calls or respond to SMS text message sent to him on the matter.
