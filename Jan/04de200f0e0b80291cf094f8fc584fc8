Commenting on the development, Mr Ambrose Omordion, the Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd., said that the market did not react to the inflation data due to Monetary Policy Committee meeting slated for next week. “I think the decision of MPC members next week will give clearer picture of the next economic direction,”Omordion stated.
