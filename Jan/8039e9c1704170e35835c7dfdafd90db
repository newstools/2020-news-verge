Gov. Yahaya Bello of Kogi has congratulated Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State and his counterpart, Gov. Simon Lalong of Plateau and Chairman, Northern Governors’ Forum, on their victories at the Supreme Court on Monday.  In a statement issued by the Governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Onogwu Muhammed, on Monday in Lokoja, Bello described the victories as well deserved and confirmation of the overwhelming support given to them by the people of their respective states. According to him, the verdicts of the seven-man panel of justices of the supreme court, affirming Ganduje and Lalong in their separate judgments as the validly elected governors of Kano and Plateau states respectively, had laid to rest all legal fireworks that trailed the earlier mandate given to them by the people of their states . He described the apex court verdicts as victories not only for the governors and their people but for the entire ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) family across the federation. Bello described Ganduje and Lalong as strong pillars of the ruling APC, adding that their enormous role in the victory of President Muhammadu Buhari in the last presidential election could not be over emphasised. “With your victories at the supreme court, you can now fully settle down to face the business of governance and delivery of more dividends of democracy to the good people of Kano and Plateau states respectively. “I urge the good people of Kano and Plateau to give their governors the needed support and cooperation to enable them to consolidate on the laudable projects and programmes the duo have started as well as those they planned to embark upon for the overall good of their people. “I congratulate you once again and pray that Almighty Allah will continue to protect and keep you in good health to enable you deliver on your campaign promises for your people during your second term in office,” the Governor said.
