A Family Court in Benin on Tuesday remanded Chigozie Matthew, 30, in Oko Correctional Centre for allegedly raping a 17-year-old girl.  The Chief Magistrate, (Mrs) Adamaigbo Dorothy remanded the accused person in custody and adjourned the case until March 25, for hearing. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Sgt. Ifidon Daniel, told the Court that the accused person committed the offence sometime in Jan. 6, 2020. He said that the offence was committed at Okey Golden Hotel, at Nomayo Street, Upper Sakponba road, Benin, in the Ikpoba-Okhai Magisterial district. He said that the offence contravened section 357 and punishable under section 358 of the Criminal Code, Cap 48, volume II, laws of the defunct Bendel State of Nigeria 1976, as applicable in Edo. According to prosecution, “the accused on the same date did unlawfully have canal knowledge of a teenager, aged 17 years, and thereby committed the offence.” He added that granting the accused person bail will jeopardise investigation. The accused, however, pleaded not guilty when the charge was read in Court. It was reported that person who commits the offence of rape is liable upon conviction to imprisonment to up to life, with or without caning. It was also reported that age of consent for sex in Benin is 18 years and anyone who engages in sex with persons bellow the age is liable whether or not the partner is in agreement for the act.
