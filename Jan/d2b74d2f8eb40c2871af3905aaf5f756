Manchester United thrashed English football league third tier Tranmere Rovers 6-0 on Sunday to join Manchester City in the fifth round of the FA Cup.  A muddy and bobbly Prenton Park pitch looked the perfect stage for a shock but Tranmere Rovers were blown away as Harry Maguire’s early thunderbolt settled any Manchester United jitters. Tranmere Rovers had knocked out English Premier League (EPL) Watford in a replay on Thursday. But apart from an early flurry of pressure they were never in Sunday’s tie as United scored five times before the break. Diogo Dalot, who like Maguire had not scored all season, made it 2-0 after weaving into the penalty area and delivering a fierce finish. Later on, Jesse Lingard curled a right-footed shot inside the post for only his second goal of the season. Phil Jones got in on the act with a looping header from a corner kick, ending his own near six-year goal drought. Anthony Martial added a fifth goal just before the break. It was the first time since 2001 that Manchester United had scored five before half-time and they continued the onslaught after the break when Mason Greenwood converted a 56th-minute penalty kick. Earlier, holders Manchester City beat Championship side Fulham 4-0. It was a task made easier as Fulham played virtually the whole game with 10 men after Tim Ream was red-carded for conceding a penalty kick converted by Ilkay Gundogan. Bernardo Silva made it 2-0 and Gabriel Jesus scored twice after the break as Manchester City reached 100 goals for the season in all competitions. They are the first club to do so in Europe’s top leagues.
