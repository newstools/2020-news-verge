Some civil servants and residents of Adamawa have commended Gov. Ahmadu Fintiri for redeeming some of his 2019 campaign promises.  They expressed their feelings in separate interviews with our reporter on Thursday in Yola. Some of the promises fulfilled by the governor, according to them, included the implementation of minimum wage, prompt payment of salaries, conduct of local council election, construction of township roads, and the payment of WAEC and NECO fees to students. One of the workers, Mr Usman Aminu, said the governor deserved commendation for the prompt payment of salary and implementation of N32,000 minimum wage. “Since he assumed duty in May 2019 we are getting our salary between 23rd and 25th of each month as promised. “He also fulfilled his promise to pay above N30,000 minimum wage by implementing N32,000,” Aminu said. Mr Mr Emmanuel Fashe, the state Chairman of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), said workers were happy with the implementation of the new minimum wage. He, however, said that negotiation was still ongoing regarding adjustment for other workers yet to start benefiting. Malam Abubakar Abdulsalam, an activist, also lauded the governor for conducting council election as promised. On his part, Mr Joseph Baba, also said many parents were excited over the school feeding programme and the payment of WAEC and NECO fees of final year students by the state government.
