After two days loss, trading activities rebounded on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) on Thursday following investors’ interest in some highly capitalised equities.  Specifically, the market capitalisation of listed equities grew by N150 billion or one per cent to close at N15.142 trillion against N14.992 trillion posted on Wednesday. In the same vein, the All-Share Index (ASI) inched 289.63 points, representing a growth of one per cent to close at 29,352.13 against 29,062.50 achieved on Wednesday. The upturn was impacted by gains recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Dangote Cement, MTN Nigeria, Forte Oil, Lafarge Africa and Unilever Nigeria. Speaking on market outlook, Mr Ambrose Omordion, the Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd., said that investors were taking advantage of price correction to increase their stake in the market. Omordion said they were increasing their stake ahead of the release of the nation’s December inflation data, first Monetary Policy Committee meeting of the year as well as release of 2019 earnings reports. He said that prevailing low-interest rate regime in the money market contributed to the uptrend experienced in the stock market.
