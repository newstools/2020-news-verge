Controversial hip-hop artist, Azeez Fashola, a.k.a Naira Marley, has advised the Federal Government to empower the Nigerian youth and take them away from the streets.  The singer stated this via his Twitter handle @officialnairam1. He wrote: “Our government’s creating conditions for trouble that can have dramatic consequences. “Neglecting youths on the street with no hope, no support and no future, ” he tweeted. According to the singer, what the government is creating can have a dramatic effect. Marley recently advised his fans, who he called ‘Marlians’ to live right in order not to destroy their future. He also appealed to the youth not to endanger their future while enjoying their lives. According to him, as you enjoy your life, you should not also destroy your future. It was reported that the Director-General, National Orientation Agency (NOA), Mr Garba Abari, had earlier advised youths not to emulate the heinous lifestyle of any Nigerian artiste. Abari also called on parents to teach their wards the norms and values expected of them, check the movies they watch and the people they relate with on social media.
