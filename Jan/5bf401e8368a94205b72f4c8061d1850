The members of National Youth Service Corps have started receiving their monthly allowance. The bitter truth is that it is still 19800. Feeders from youth Corpers serving in Niger State expressed their shock and disappointment in the Federal Government of Nigeria when they got a credit alert of 19800. You would recollect that as an effect of the salary adjustment, the Corpers were expecting an automatic increase which is well stipulated in the NYSC bye laws that the monthly allowance would be at least the minimum wage. By calculation, some Corpers were expecting to get an alert of 30,000 while for some 31,800 while some others are expecting 32,700. But as at the time of filing this report, the monthly allowance is still 19,800. However some Corpers and NYSC staffs have expressed optimism over an increase in the monthly allowance in the coming months
