Rivers Government on Tuesday denied statements alleging that Gov. Nyesom Wike berated the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for losing Imo governorship seat to the ruling APC.  It was reported the Supreme Court had recently sacked Mr Emeka Ihedioha as governor of Imo, resulting to protests in some parts of the country. Mr Paulinus Nsirim, Commissioner for Information and Communications in Rivers, said in a statement in Port Harcourt that the allegation against Rivers governor was the imagination of mischief makers. He said: “The attention of Rivers Government has been drawn to news circulating in the social media that Gov. Wike insulted the leadership of the PDP. “The author of the fake news quoted the governor as saying that PDP has gone totally insane. “Those who are close to the governor know that he has very high regards for the leadership of the PDP.’’ Nsirim described Gov. Wike as an accomplished legal practitioner that would never use such a rude language to talk about a party he laboured selflessly to build. “So, Gov. Wike never berated the PDP for staging a protest against the Supreme Court judgment that ousted Emeka Ihedioha from office. “It is laughable that mischief makers think they can use fake news to whittle down the rising political profile of the governor. “Wike remains a strong pillar, committed and loyal party man, who should not be associated with call to sack the National Chairman of PDP, Prince Uche Secondus,” he pointed out. The commissioner claimed the allegation was handiwork of moles within the PDP that would stop at nothing to discredit Gov. Wike for selfish gains. According to him, the public should disregard the ‘fake news’ circulating in the social media as it has no iota of truth in it.
