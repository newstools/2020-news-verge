A Nigerian court on Thursday issued an arrest warrant for former oil minister Dan Etete and two others in relation to an oilfield that is the subject of corruption cases in Italy and Nigeria, the governmentâ€™s anti-fraud unit told Reuters. EFCC attorney Balance Sanga said the arrest warrant was a precursor for declaring Etete wanted before the country sought Interpol help in apprehending him.
