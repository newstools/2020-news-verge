The Trump administration on Wednesday unveiled plans to add Africa’s most populous country, Nigeria and six more countries to the United States of America’s travel ban list, including those in Asia, report says. Immigrants from the handful of countries — Belarus, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Sudan and Tanzania — could face restrictions on specific kinds of visas, administration officials told the Wall Street Journal. They could also be barred from entering the diversity visa lottery, which doles out green cards to people in countries with low levels of immigration to the US as part of a program that Trump has sought to end. Trump teased plans to expand the controversial list at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland but said the names of the new countries would be announced “very shortly.” “We are adding a couple of countries to it. We have to be safe. Our country has to be safe,” he said. The newest ban will roll out on Monday — the three-year anniversary of Trump signing the initial ban that blocked travelers to the US from several majority-Muslim countries. That ban was struck down twice in federal court before a third version was upheld in June 2018. The current iteration blocks travel to the US by individuals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and North Korea, as well as political officials from Venezuela.
