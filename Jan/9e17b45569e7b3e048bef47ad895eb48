Plateau Governor Simon Lalong on Thursday visited Kombun community in Mangu Local Government which came under attack by unknown gunmen few days ago.  Thirteen people were confirmed killed in the attack that left many injured and many houses razed down. Lalong, while commiserating with the families that lost loved ones, cautioned youths of the community against the temptation to attack people suspected to have a hand in the incident. He urged the youths to remain calm and not allow the situation to escalate to other communities by taking laws into their hands. The governor assured the residents of protection against further attacks, promising that security personnel would be deployed to areas where there was tension. “I urge the youths not to be in a haste to block roads during such attacks because that usually delay security agencies from coming to tackle the invaders. We must cooperate with the authorities,” he said. He said that it was unfortunate that evil perpetrators were trying to disrupt the fragile peace on the Plateau, and urged Plateau residents to support the quest to end the violence by remaining steadily alert. In his remarks, the District Head of Kombun, Audu Tetmut, said that the community had been peaceful without record of a dispute with anyone. He commended the governor for his prompt response to their plight and assured him of the people’s cooperation with security agencies. It was reported that special prayers were conducted by Rev Jacob Dashop, for peace in the community.
