Mr John Adeleke, the Executive Chairman, Oyo State Internal Revenue Service (OYIRS), has said that the state governor, Mr Seyi Makinde, is determined to improve the fortunes of the state by boosting its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR).  Adeleke said on Monday in Ibadan while briefing newsmen ahead of the forthcoming one-day tax stakeholders’ summit scheduled to hold in Ibadan. He said that the administration of Makinde had been vigorously pursuing improved IGR since its inception.
