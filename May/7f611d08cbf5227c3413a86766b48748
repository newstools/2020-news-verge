The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has saluted Nigerian workers on the occasion of 2020 Workers’ Day celebration, describing them as the life force of the nation.  The party gave the commendations in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, on Thursday in Abuja to mark the workers day. Ologbondiyan commended Nigerian workers for their sacrifices toward the well being of the nation, particularly at the critical time many of them were on the frontline against the spread COVID-19. “The PDP hails the resilience of workers in the health and other essential services, who have continued to exhibit unequaled patriotism, despite the daunting challenges, in the overall effort to mitigate the health, economic and social impacts of the scourge. “These citizens are indeed our national heroes. “The party notes that the Nigerian workers have continued to work hard in every sector to ensure the unity, stability and economic growth of our dear nation as well as standing as a strong voice for the entrenchment of equity, social justice and rule of law in the polity,” he said. Ologbondiyan said it was depressing that the 2020 Workers Day came at a time when the world was on lockdown over the COVID-19 pandemic, but noted that such did not detract from the essence of the celebration. He, however, urged workers not to deter in their commitment toward nation building.
