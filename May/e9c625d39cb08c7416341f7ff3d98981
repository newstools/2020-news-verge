Gov. AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara has expressed his administration’s commitment to carrying all the children in the state along, saying that none of them would be denied his/her rights and privileges.  The governor stated this in a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary (CPS), Rafiu Ajakaye, on Wednesday in Ilorin to commemorate the 2020 Children’s Day. He said that his administration also remained committed to gender-inclusion, stressing that its huge investments in education had given the girl-child in the state a head-start. “Our administration stands in firm solidarity with the Kwara child and other children all over the world, as our country again commemorates the Children’s Day. “Our policy is to ensure that no child is left behind or denied every right and privilege to compete with his/her peers,” the governor said. It was reported that the theme for this year’s Day is: “Promoting Girl-Child Education for Sustainable Development.” The governor said that his administration had given the girl- child the right to say that her state held the ace on the African continent, in terms of women-inclusion in governance. “We also had the girl-child in mind when we enrolled our state in the national school feeding programme because of its consequences for increased school enrollment, reduction of out-of-school children, poverty reduction and women empowerment. “Our investments in the primary education sector, including paying better attention to children with special education needs, are designed to secure a brighter future for the Kwara child. “Even in this time of COVID-19 pandemic, the administration has ensured that the children continue to get attention through our radio and online classes. “While wishing all our children happy celebrations, the administration assures them that nothing will be left undone to protect them from all forms of abuse, violence and stigmatisation,” he said.
