Lagos State Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu has commiserated with the management and staff of the New Telegraph newspaper on the death of its former Saturday Editor, Alhaji Waheed Bakare.  In a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Gboyega Akosile, on Tuesday, the governor described the death as painful. He said that Bakare was a prolific writer, who had a promising journalism career. He said that the demise of Bakare was a rude shock to his family, friends, colleagues and associates, but should be accepted as the will of God. ”We should be consoled by the modest achievements of the late editor. Death is inevitable, as we all will die. ”Our goal in life is not to live forever, but to create something that will outlive us, bearing in mind that it is not the length of life that matters but the depth. ”Waheed lived an exemplary life. He was a devout Muslim, a dutiful husband and a good father. ”Above all, he touched millions of lives through his chosen profession as a journalist, who rose to the position of Saturday Editor of a national newspaper,” he said. Sanwo-Olu also consoled with the Lagos State chapter and the national body of the Nigeria Union of Journalists as well as the Nigeria Guild of Editors. ”No doubt, the Nigeria Union of Journalists both at the state and the national levels, as well as the Nigeria Guild of Editors will by now be mourning the loss of an illustrious member. I pray that God will comfort you. ”May God comfort his immediate family, friends and associates. May God grant them the fortitude to bear the irreplaceable loss. ”May He grant the soul of Waheed al-Jannah firdaus. Amen,” the governor said.
