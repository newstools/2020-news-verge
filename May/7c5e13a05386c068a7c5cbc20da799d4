According to NCDC, as at 11.20pm, May 7, 2020 Nigeria has 2818 Active Cases of COVID-19 while 601 people have been discharged. The centre said the continuous increase in number of infections rose due to the increased capacity for testing across the country. It was reported that the agency has conducted 22,492 tests as at May 6, this represents the daily average of 321 tests. The cumulative per cent positive is 13.9 per cent. The agency conducted 68 per cent of all tests in the last 20 days and 32 per cent of all tests were conducted in the first 50 days. The agency also increased its testing capacity from one Labotary to 18 labs in 70 days. The testing method adopted by the NCDC appears to be the high tech molecular tests, which involves Polymerase Chain Reaction(PCR), to detect virus genetic material. This method involved significant cycle and turn around time. The reported cases as at May 7, represents 12 per cent of all cases recorded in 69 days in the country.
