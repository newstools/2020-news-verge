Gov. Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State has felicitated with Muslim faithful the world-over on the successful completion of Ramadan fast and celebration of Eid- el-Fitr.  This was contained in a statement he personally signed on Saturday in Lafia. “For the past 29 days, Muslims all over the world have observed the fast in the sacred month of Ramadan in compliance with the Islamic injunction. “As you are all aware, fasting in the month of Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam aimed at strengthening our faith through spiritual engagements such as abstinence from eating, drinking and satisfying other desires from sunset to dawn. “It also involves intense prayers, recitation and interpretation of the Holy Qur’an, as well as increased acts of kindness, charity and humility, among other moral virtues. “I implore all Muslims to remain steadfast in applying the virtues of Ramadan through sustained supplication, hospitality and good neighbourliness for the overall peace, security and economic prosperity,” he said. Sule said government will not condone any act capable of breaching the existing peace prevailing in the state and threatened to deal with criminal elements if caught no matter their status in the society. The governor also reminded religion leaders to obey the conditions given for lifting of ban on religious gathering in order to contain the spread of coronavirus. Sule urged Muslim faithful in the state to ensure that they use facemasks, maintain physical distancing and hand sanitisers in all mosques in line with the directive towards containing COVID-19 spread.
