The Wife of Ondo State Governor, Mrs Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu, has advised children in the state to stay safe, just as she allayed their fears concerning the novel coronavirus disease.  Akeredolu, who spoke through her media aide, Oluwatobi Fademi on Wednesday in Akure, assure that “it (COVID-19) will soon be history’’. She decried the discomfort currently being experienced by the children in this period of lockdown, describing it as a deviation from the normal life they have been exposed to. According to her, this is a message of comfort to Ondo state children. “No schooling, no playing and socialising with their friends among others, which could be exasperating. “They should hang in there, we shall overcome,’’ she said. The governor’s wife described children as the most valuable in society, noting that children are the hopes of a better future. “As such, their potentials and development must be guided jealously by any government or individual.’’ Mrs Akeredolu maintained that without children, the world would be devoid of happiness, love and innovations. She added that they must, therefore be guided, protected, loved and cared for. She urge children in the state not to jettison independent learning and reading during this period, but leverage on the use of information and computer technology (ICT) to engage in e-learning via several digital platforms. She expressed the belief that this would enable them compete favourably with their counterparts across the globe. She also wish them well as they commemorate 2020 Children’s Day. She reminded the children of the need to serve as change agents in the fight against COVID-19, maintain personal hygiene, social distancing, make use of face masks and adhere to other precautionary measures, set up by the government, to prevent them from contracting the virus.
