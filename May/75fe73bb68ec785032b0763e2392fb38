The Management of the University of Benin (UNIBEN) has advised members of staff to continue to work from home until further directive from the Ministry Education.  This is contained in a statement by the institution’s Public Relations Officer, Dr Benedicta Ehanire, made available to newsmen on Friday in Benin. She said the staff members should maintain the status quo and work from home for now. She made the clarification based on the Edo State Head of Service’s directives on the resumption of work by certain cadres in the public service in state. Ehanire said, “in the wake of the continuous uncertainties regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and in line with the position of the Federal Ministry of Education, no specific date has been fixed for the reopening.” She urged UNIBEN staff members to continue to work from home saying, resumption date would be received from the Federal Ministry of Education. “Staff on essential duties are to maintain all the hygiene and safety rules as stipulated by the NCDC,” she said.
