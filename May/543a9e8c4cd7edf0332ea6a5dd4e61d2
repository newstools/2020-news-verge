Dr Dakuku Perterside, former Director General of the Nigeria Maritime and Safety Agency (NIMASA), has described the death of Simeon Nwakaudu, an aide to Rivers Governor, Nyesom Wike, as a great loss.  It was reported that Nwakaudu, Special Assistant on Electronic Media to Wike, died on Sunday in a Port Harcourt hospital, after a brief illness. Peterside, said in a statement issued in Port Harcourt on Monday, that his death had created a vacuum in Wike’s administration; and was also a huge loss to the media industry. “Mr Nwakaudu died when all expertise was required to battle the Coronavirus pandemic and beyond. “The deceased was very loyal to his principal and passionate about his responsibilities,” he said. He noted that the governor had lost a trusted ally and staff, who was a gentleman and professional in his carriage. He prayed to God to grant the deceased’s family the fortitude to bear such a huge loss, at a time when his fatherly admonitions were most needed. “I might have, on a couple of occasions, disagreed with the principles and politics of his Principal, but I have great admiration for him as a thoroughbred professional. “Let me express my deepest condolences to Governor Wike over this sad loss. He has lost a good ally, and I pray for God’s grace and guidance over the wife and children he left behind,” Peterside said.
