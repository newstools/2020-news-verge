The kidnapped twins of a popular Ibadan-based cleric, Shelkh Taofeek Akewugbagold, were on Sunday released to their father at about 5.30 am by their abductors.  Our correspondent reports that the twins were kidnapped at gun point at their father’s residence at Abatakan, Ojoo area of Ibadan at about 8pm on April 25. Akewugbagold, who confirmed the release on his Facebook page on Sunday, said he took custody of the twins near a bush path. “Alhamdulilah, at 5.30 am of Sunday May 3, my abducted twins kids were released to me beside a bush after 8 days in the unknown land. “Thanks to all of you for your prayers and support,” Akewugbagold said in the post.
