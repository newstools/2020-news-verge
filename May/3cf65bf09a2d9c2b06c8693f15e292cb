A police station in Minneapolis has been set alight during a third night of protests over the death of an unarmed black man in custody on Monday. A police officer was filmed kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, 46, despite him saying he could not breathe. President Donald Trump said “thugs” were dishonouring his memory and called on the National Guard to restore order. The incident has added to anger over police killings of black Americans, including Breonna Taylor in Kentucky. Mr Floyd’s family have demanded that the four police officers implicated in his death face murder charges. Prosecutors have said they are still gathering evidence. A CNN journalist, Omar Jimenez, and his camera crew were arrested live on air by Minnesota state police officers on Friday morning, apparently because they did not move on when instructed. The team was released an hour later, after the governor apologised for the arrest. Also, there have been demonstrations in other US cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, Phoenix and Memphis.
