The Itori Unit Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Ogun has warned motorists against flouting the overloading order.  The Itori Unit Commander of FRSC, Mr Sunday Oko, gave the warning in an interview with our reporter in Ota on Sunday. Oko said that no fewer than 15 erring motorists had been apprehended in the last three weeks of the lockdown. “The FRSC will not relent in its efforts at arresting motorists disobeying the over loading directive of the Federal Government in the bid to contain further spread of COVID-19 pandemic. “We observe that these drivers plying Itori axis in Ogun have their own tricks by always adjusting and conforming to the directive before getting to FRSC officials and other sister agencies on the highways,” he said. He commended the people of Itori for their high level compliance with the stay at home order, urging them to continue to strictly embrace social distancing, good hygiene practices and use of face masks among others to curtail the further spread of COVID-19.
