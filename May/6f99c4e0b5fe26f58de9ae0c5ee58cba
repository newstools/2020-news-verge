PDP in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, in Abuja, described Okoro’s death as `a huge national loss’ given his unalloyed dedication, commitment and relentless sacrifices towards the unity, development and stability of Nigeria. “Sen. Okoro was a seasoned politician, a quintessential democrat and excellent parliamentarian, who played key roles in the development of our democracy. “In the Senate, Okoro’s contributions as the Chairman, Senate Committee on Industries as well as member of Senate committees on Police Affairs, Agriculture and Niger Delta in the fourth Senate, were pivotal in ensuring good governance, accountability and prudence in those sectors of our national life under the PDP administration. “Okoro was an exceptionally committed member of the Board of Trustees of our great party and remained dedicated to the ideal of the PDP and the visions of our founding fathers to the end,” he said. Ologbondiyan commiserated with the Governor of Enugu State, Mr Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, the Okoro family, the PDP family in Enugu State, his Nsukka kindred as well as the government and people of Enugu state. He prayed God to grant them all the fortitude the bear the irreparable loss.
