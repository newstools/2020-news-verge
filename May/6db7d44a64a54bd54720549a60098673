Gov. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has described the appointment of Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, as the Chief of Staff (CoS) to President Muhammadu Buhari, as a round peg in a round hole.  It was reported that Buhari on Wednesday appointed Gambari as his Chief of Staff to replace Malam Abba Kyari, who died on April 17. Mr Olusegun Ajiboye, Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, in a statement on Wednesday in Akure, said Akeredolu made the description in view of Gambari’s experience in both national and global politics. According to the governor, Gambari’s long public career and as a university teacher will come in handy in his new role. “With the experience garnered over the years as an astute diplomat and a gentleman, Ambassador Gambari is bringing his wealth of experience to enhance the good works of the President and his cabinet,” he said. While wishing Gambari success in his new role, Akeredolu said he was confident that the new Chief of Staff would not disappoint the nation. The governor thanked the President for his choice, adding that the appointment of Gambari has once again shown President Buhari as a leader who mean well for the nation.
