Minister of Interior, Mr Rauf Aregbesola, has donated food items to the people of Ile-Ife, Osun, to complement efforts of Federal Government at combating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.  Aregbesola, a former governor of Osun, was represented by a former Commissioner for Home Affairs in the state, Mr Sikiru Ayedun, during the distribution on Monday. Ayedun said that the minister gave the items to help alleviate the sufferings of the people during the lockdown. He said that the minister deemed it fit to contribute his quota to make life bearable for the people. According to him, beneficiaries will get their items through their leaders including, those of NURTW, Religious leaders, Okada Riders, Tricycle Operators, Iyaloja, Babaloja and Political leaders, among others. Ayedun said the headship of each segment of beneficiaries had been given the foodstuffs and had promised that it would get to the targeted persons. Chief Taiwo Adedinni, Leader, Nigeria Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) Ife East Branch, who spoke on behalf of others, lauded Aregbesola, for his good gesture. Adedinni said the minister was worthy of emulation because not all that governed their states would still consider their people for good after leaving office. He therefore, appealed to other dignitaries to be generous to the masses now and after the shutdown. It was reported that the food items distributed include bags of rice, beans, garri, tubers of yams and noddles.
