Kano State Government had begun the second phase distribution of food items to 50,000 households, to cushion the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown.  Gav. Abdullahi Ganduje, who inaugurated the distribution exercise on Thursday in Kano, said the gesture was aimed at ameliorating the suffering of the masses. Ganduje said that the state government had adopted proactive measures to ensure equitable distribution of the relief items to the targeted vulnerable persons. He explained that the distribution exercise targeted orphans, widows, physically-challenged persons and inmates of correctional centers, among others. The governor described the first phase of the exercise which also targeted 50, 000 households as “successful.” Ganduje lauded President Muhammadu Buhari for allocating 139 trucks of assorted food items to the state. Also speaking, the Chairman of the state’s COVID-19 Fund Rising Committee, Prof Yahuza Bello, said that the beneficiaries were selected carefully in each of the over 400 wards in the state. Bello said the items would be distributed to the targeted persons to ensure that the aim of the gesture is achieved. Meanwhile, Gov. Ganduje inaugurated a sample collection center at Middle Road in Sabon Gari area of Kano metropolis. Ganduje said the gesture was to enhance access to sample collection centre and ease difficulties being experienced by the people in travelling long distances for the coronavirus test. He noted that his administration does not tag the residents of Sabon Gari area as non indigenes, because everybody is an instrument for the development of the state. On his part, Rev. Adeola Adeyemo, the Chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the state, commended the governor for not attaching religious sentiment or tribalism in the execution of government policies and programmes.
