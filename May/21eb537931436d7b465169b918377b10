Gov. Gboyega Oyetola of Osun, on Monday visited a major market in Osogbo to sensitise traders on precautionary measures against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as the statewide lockdown eased.  Oyetola, during the visit to popular Igbonna market in Osogbo, commended the traders for adhering to the stay-at-home order which lasted for more than four weeks. He thanked them for assisting government to control the spread of the virus by staying away from the markets, despite the current harsh economic realities. According to the governor, the closure of markets across the state in the last four weeks, had reduced the number of new infections as indicated by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The governor, however, urged the traders and their customers to continue to maintain personal hygiene with the use of face masks, hand sanitisers, regular washing of hands as well as physical distancing. Oyetola appealed to the traders to continue to adhere strictly to all precautionary guidelines against COVID-19, stressing that markets were veritable sources of community transmission of the dreaded virus. Some of the traders, who lauded the governor for the visit, promised to abide by all the guidelines to check the spread of the virus. Mrs Folakemi Adeojo, a pepper seller said the visit was a moral booster to the traders to play their part in the fight against the virus. Also, Alhaji Ibrahim Olaiya, another trader said the governorâ€™s visit to the market would serve as a continous reminder for them to be cautious against the virus. Recall that Oyetola had announced the easing of the lockdown of the state from May 4, having been shut since March 31 to curb the spread of COVID-19.
