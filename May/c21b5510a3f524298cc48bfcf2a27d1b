The Management of the University of Benin (UNIBEN), says several dilapidated structures in its institution are currently undergoing renovations.  Dr Benedicta Ehanire, the UNIBEN Public Relations Officer, disclosed this in a statement to newsmen on Wednesday in Benin. The dilapidated structures are block of flats and housing units, which had not been painted for decades and the twin lecture theaters in the Faculty of Social Sciences, John Harris Library and the University Demonstration Secondary Schools among others. According to her, these are the work of the purpose-driven and committed Vice Chancellor, Prof. Lilian Salami. “A visit to the site showed construction workers observing required physical distancing as dictated by the COVID-19 phenomenon. “Also receiving attention is the John Harris Library and the University Demonstration Secondary School, while the collapsed wall of Ekehuan campus and other fallen perimeter fences in the Ugbowo campus have been fixed. “The Salami-led management had earlier renovated the University Staff School (primary) and refurbished the amenities, including chairs and desks,” she said. Ehanire said the UNIBEN table water factory had also been refurbished and repositioned for optimum performance.
