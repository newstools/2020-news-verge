President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has felicitated Nigerian workers as they join their counterparts the world over to mark this year Workers’ Day.  Lawan gave the message in a statement signed by his Special Adviser (Media), Mr Ola Awoniyi in Abuja on Thursday. Lawan congratulated Nigerian workers for sustaining their heroic struggle for the liberation of the country from poverty and underdevelopment even in the face of the daunting challenges at various work places. The Senate President acknowledged the role of workers as the creator of wealth in the society and stressed that it was for this reason that they should be appreciated at all times. “The best way to appreciate the enormous contributions of Nigerian workers is to always consider their welfare as of utmost importance. “As a legislature, we are ever ready to work in collaboration with the organised labour unions to rid our statute books of any anti-labour laws,” Lawan said. The Senate President said as part of the effort of the 9th National Assembly to strengthen the economy and improve the standard of living of the people, it was determined to make the country’s financial year predictable through timely passage of the 2020 budget. Lawan said that the National Assembly had in the same respect, made critical amendments to some laws to ensure smooth implementation of the budget. He said the Legislature would continue to move relentlessly in that direction, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Senate President noted that this year’s celebration of Workers’ Day came at a time the entire world was facing the health emergency brought about by the Coronavirus pandemic. Lawan said the resilience and never-die spirit of the Nigerian people would boost the efforts of the government to overcome the pandemic.
