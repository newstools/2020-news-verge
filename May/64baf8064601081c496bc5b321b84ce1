The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) Osogbo field office has urged petroleum marketers in the state to always take precautionary measures against coronavirus while dealing with motorists at filling stations.  Mr Olusegun Daboh, DPR Operations Controller, made the appeal in an interview with our reporter on Friday in Osogbo. Daboh said since petrol attendants would be dealing with different kinds of motorists, there was need for marketers to ensure that social distance was maintained. He said that the use of face masks should also be made compulsory for all the petrol attendants, to help in minimising the spread of the virus in the state. Daboh said the agency would soon embark on sensitisation programme to filling stations in the state on the importance of face masks and other precautionary measures against the virus. He emphasised on the need to make hand sanitisers available for petrol attendants at the filing stations. The operations controller said that since the attendants would be touching money frequently, there was the need for them to continually sanitise their hands against the virus. Daboh said the agency would continue to support the marketers in the state on the fight against the virus at the filling stations. He, however, warned against under-dispensing of product, vowing that any marketer caught would be dealt with according to the law.
