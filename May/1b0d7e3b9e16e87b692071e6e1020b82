Nasarawa State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) says it will appeal the judgment that annulled the wards and local government congresses of the party in the state.  Mr Francis Orogu, State Caretaker Chairman of PDP, stated this while briefing newsmen on Friday in Lafia. “We will challenge the judgment because it is an attempt to disorganise the party by mischief makers. “The party has already applied for a copy of the judgment from the court with the view to studying it and know the areas to challenge at the Appeal Court. “The caretaker committee in the state will not allow few political businessmen to hijack the party,’’ he said. He urged stakeholders and members of the party to remain calm as the caretaker committee was determined to discharge its duties with every sense of responsibility to unite the party. Recall that a High Court sitting in Akwanga Local Government Area on Thursday annulled the wards and local government congresses and ordered for a fresh one. It was also reported that the court had annulled the congresses over violation of an earlier court order restraining them from conducting the congresses. The court therefore described the congresses as illegal, unconstitutional and was done in violation of the party’s constitution.
