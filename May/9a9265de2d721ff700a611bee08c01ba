…Africa should be given a chance to prove its worth rather than being subjected to foreign dictates… Madagascar President, Mr. Andry Rajoelina says the criticism of an untested herbal tonic that he is touting as a treatment for COVID-19 shows the West’s condescending attitude towards Africa. NEWSVERGE recalled that the World Health Organization (WHO) warned against using untested remedies. Although the tonic has not gone through clinical trials but African Union (AU) has said that it wanted to see the scientific data on the “safety and efficacy” of the product, known as COVID-Organics. “If it was a European country that had actually discovered this remedy, would there be so much doubt? I don’t think so,” Mr Rajoelina said in an interview. He, however, warned that “African scientists… should not be underestimated.” Madagascar has reported 193 Covid-19 cases and no deaths. The tonic was tried out on fewer than 20 people over three weeks, a presidential aide told the BBC, when the product was first launched last month – which is not in line with WHO guidelines on clinical trials. Despite the reservations, several African countries, including Nigeria, Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea and Liberia, have already ordered COVID-Organics, which is produced from the artemisia plant – the source of an ingredient used in a malaria treatment – and other Malagasy plants. Meanwhile, WHO said Africans deserved access to medicines that have gone through proper trials even if they are derived from traditional treatments. At this, there is no peer-reviewed data to show that COVID-Organics is effective but it is widely believed that Africa should be given a chance to prove its worth rather than being subjected to foreign dictates.
