The Oye Local Government Council on Wednesday admonished all residents to always wear facemasks to curb the spread of the COVID-19.  The Chairman of the council, Mr Foluso Ojo, made the call in an interview with our reporter in Oye-Ekiti. Ojo said that the council would ensure that residents complied with the directive of the state and federal governments. He also urged the traditional institution to sensitise the people on the need to wear facemasks to curb the spread of the pandemic. “We are so passionate about the health of our people, I am appealing to the people in our community to always wear facemasks whenever they are going out. “The facemask is a very cheap material which people can afford to buy or even make themselves, I want to urge people to always use it. “Also, I want to appeal to the chiefs and traditional obas to continue to sensitise people on the importance of wearing facemask,” he said. Ojo assured the people that his administration would continue to deploy all possible measures to curb the spread of the deadly virus in the area.
