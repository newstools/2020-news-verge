Sanwo-Olu, in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Gboyega Akosile, on Wednesday, congratulated Gambari, describing him as the right man for the job. He described Gambari as a man of impeccable character, right temperament, leadership and knowledge. ”The choice of Professor Gambari as successor to the late Mallam Abba Kyari by President Muhammadu Buhari is commendable. “Gambari is not just an academic or a diplomat, he is a fine gentleman, a decent Nigerian who epitomises the Nigerian dream. ”My personal and official interactions with Professor Gambari have brought about nothing but meaningful development.
