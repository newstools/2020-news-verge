A lawmaker, Danjuma La’ah, representing Southern Kaduna Senatorial Zone at the National Assembly, has called on Muslim faithful to use the occasion of the Eid-el-fitr to pray for Nigeria, as the country battles with the coronavirus pandemic.  La’ah, who made this call on Friday while speaking to newsmen in Kafanchan, said that it was important to seek divine intervention to defeat the pandemic and other problems afflicting the country. On the ongoing efforts to find a local cure for the virus, the lawmaker said the legislative arm was ready to provide all the necessary support for the relevant agencies. He, however, implored Muslims to draw enduring lessons from the holy month of Ramadan, which included personal sacrifice and charitable giving. “I want to call on Muslim faithful to keep the lessons of the holy month, which involves making sacrifices and helping the less-privileged. “They should emulate the virtues of Prophet Muhammad by coexisting peacefully with others irrespective of their religious differences,” he added. He called on residents to continue to observe safety guidelines on COVID-19 and also respect the lockdown order of government to curb the spread of the disease. La’ah prayed for bumper harvest for farmers in the 2020 season, adding that he was working out modalities on his part to help local farmers achieve food security in the region.
