Two confirmed COVID-19 patients were on Wednesday discharged from the Infectious Disease Centre (IDC) at Olodo, near Ibadan, after receiving their second negative test results.  Gov. Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, who disclosed this on his twitter handle, said the discharged patients bring the number of discharged cases in the state to 13. “We also have a further update on the two cases who absconded and were reported earlier today. “They absconded before being admitted to any of our isolation centres. “After intensive contact-tracing, one of them has been found and admitted to the IDC in Olodo. “The other is a 10-year-old boy who eyewitnesses claim boarded a Northern State-bound vehicle. His details have been sent to the Sokoto State PHEOC. “Contact-tracing is still ongoing,” the governor added.
