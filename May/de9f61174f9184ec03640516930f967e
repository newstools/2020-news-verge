She assured Lagos residents that alternative routes had been made available for motorists plying the axis to enable them reach their destination with ease. “Motorists going to Liverpool/TinCan Ports from Wharf gate will be directed to Eleganza to connect Warehouse Road to access Trebor. “Marine Road, Oduduwa Road, Park Lane, Central and North Avenue will be available for motorists leaving the Tin-can Port area. “Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) will deploy its personnel to manage and control traffic along the construction corridor, road diversion axis, intersections and junctions,” Ogunlola said.
