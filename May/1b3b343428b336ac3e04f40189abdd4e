The Senator John Owan-Enoh Foundation has donated palliatives to over 66 diabetics patients in Cross River Central Senatorial District.  It was reported that the palliative included wheat, groundnut oil, salt, rice, Maggie seasoning and other household items. It was also reported that the foundation, which is geared towards raising awareness of the public on the treatment and prevention of diabetes, also offers counseling and aid to diabetic patients in the state. Owan-Enoh, a former lawmaker in the National Assembly, said that the gesture was to reach out to people in the society with a view to cushion the effect of restrictions occasioned by COVID-19. The former lawmaker, who was represented by the Programme Manager of the Foundation, Mrs Nyce Manyo-Neji, said the patients were also vulnerable; hence they needed support and what to eat. “If you followed the narrative on COVID-19, diabetics are classified as part of those that are most vulnerable to contracting the virus because they have pre-existing conditions. “So, I believe that reaching out to them will enable them to have what to eat and also to build their immune system. “We may not be able to reach everyone, but at least, those who are vulnerable and having some pre-existing conditions are a starting point. “Since we already have a foundation that was set up several years ago, it is important that we reach out to them at this point in time. “For now, the target is for the 66 wards in Cross River Central; and surely, each ward has a beneficiary. “By November when we want to celebrate this year’s World Diabetic Day, we would have the ability to reach out to the other two senatorial districts of the state”, he said. Owan-Enoh stated that the foundation will stop at nothing to ensure everyone living with diabetes get the required information and care. He, however, urged the general public to adhere to all necessary precautionary measures as stipulated by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).
