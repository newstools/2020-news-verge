Prof. Sulyman Age Abdulkareem, the Vice-Chancellor, University of Ilorin, has felicitated with Prof. Ibrahim Gambari on his appointment as the Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari.  Abdulkareem, in a statement signed by the institution’s Director of Corporate Affairs, Mr Kunle Akogun, on Monday, said the appointment of the renowned scholar and outstanding diplomat was one of the best things to have happened to Nigeria in recent times. He said that the university was especially happy for the renowned academic and consummate diplomat, who was Guest Speaker during the institution’s 34th Convocation Ceremony in 2018. The vice-chancellor said that the University of Ilorin was delighted with the appointment of Gambari, whom he described as an eminent son and great friend of the university and its host community. Abdulkareem recalled that the University of Ilorin had on a number of occasions in the past benefitted Gambari’s scholarship and deep experience. He said that Gambari had honoured the university’s invitations on at least two occasions during which he delivered thought-provoking and intellectually-stimulating lectures. Abdulkareem said that Gambari’s appointment befits the resume of the nation’s longest-serving Permanent Representative to the United Nations in view of his scholarly candour, humility, resourcefulness and apolitical disposition. According to him, Gambari is imbued with what it takes to assist President Buhari in steering the wheel of the nation to the promised land. He also congratulated the Kwara State Governor, Malam AbdulRahman AbdulRazak on the appointment of a foremost Kwara indigene to that exalted position. The vice-chancellor also rejoiced with the Emir of Ilorin, Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, on the appointment of the illustrious Ilorin prince. Abdulkareem prayed Allah to grant the new Chief of Staff all it would take him to have a very successful tenure of office.
