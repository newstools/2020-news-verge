The Minister of Labour and Employment, Sen. Chris Ngige has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for choosing Prof Ibrahim Gambari, an aristocrat, as his new Chief of Staff.  In a statement signed by his media aide, Mr Emmanuel Nzomiwu on Wednesday, Ngige said Buhari could not have made a better choice than Gambari. According to him, Gambari is a renowned scholar and a front-line gladiator in international politics and diplomacy, an aristocrat with high intellectual background, imbued with vast public service experience. Ngige congratulated Gambari on his new appointment saying that it was well deserved. It was reported that Gambari was appointed to fill the vacuum created in the Buhari administration by the death of former Chief of Staff, Malam Abba Kyari. Ngige recalled that Gambari had at different times in the past, distinguished himself as External Affairs Minister from January 1984 to August 1985, Ambassador/Permanent Representative of Nigeria to the United Nations from 1990 to 1999 and Chairperson African Union Commission. “It is our hope that his huge knowledge of public service and wealth of experience will be brought to bear on the domestic policies of the Buhari administration and foreign policy thrust, to chart a new course in these trying times,” he said. Ngige expressed optimism that Gambari would make immeasurable and invaluable contributions towards the realisation of the next level agenda of the Buhari administration, geared towards achieving a united, economically viable and prosperous Nigeria. He wished the new Chief of Staff the best of luck as he embarked on his new assignment and assured him of the full cooperation of the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment.
