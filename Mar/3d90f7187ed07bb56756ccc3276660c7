Sell pressure continued on the nation’s bourse on Wednesday with the market indices declining further by 3.35 per cent, amid loses in blue chips.  Our correspondent reports that sentiments remained weak in the equities market as investors sell-off of bellwether stocks dampened market performance. Speficially, the All-Share Index dropped to 23,000 mark losing 815.91 points or 3.35 per cent to close at 23,572.75 against 24,388.66 recorded on Tuesday. Consequently, Month-to-Date and Year-to-Date losses settled at at -10.1 per cent and -12.2 per cent, respectively. Also, the market capitalisation shed N425 billion to close at N12.284 trillion in contrast with N12.709 trillion on Tuesday. The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Nestle Nigeria, Dangote Cement, Conoil, NASCON Allied Industries and Zenith Bank. Analysts at Afrinvest Limited maintained a bearish outlook on the equities market in the next trading session. Mr Ambrose Omordion, the Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd., attributed the market bear-run to local and foreign factors. Omordion said the factors were the recent crash in crude oil prices and COVID-19 which propelled corporate and sovereign debt crisis, especially among oil-dependent countries like Nigeria. He added that the fear of a likely devaluation of naira and planned downward review of the 2020 budget to reflect the new economic realities contributed to the current market trend. “This current market situation will not last after this panicky sell down that just hit the global and local markets, especially as the Nigerian market is trading at its four-year low in the midst of the 2020 earnings reporting season,” he said.
