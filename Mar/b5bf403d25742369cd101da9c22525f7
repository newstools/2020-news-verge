The Plateau chapter of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has conducted its local government congresses on Monday adhering to safety advice against the COVID-19 pandemic.  The exercise was initially slated to hold on March 21 but was rescheduled because of the threats of the pandemic. The Publicity Secretary of the party, Sir John Akans, told our reporter on Tuesday in Jos that the party complied with safety advice given by the Federal Government and the State Government, in conducting the election. “At all the venues of the congresses water and soap were provided for the delegates to wash their hands. “Hand sanitisers were also made available to ensure that no delegates or those conducting the elections were infected. “Besides, social distancing was strictly observed as delegates were called according to council wards for accreditation and voting. “As a precautionary measure, the party ensured that there was no congestion at any point of the congresses,” Akans said. He said the exercise went on smoothly in all the local governments across the state except Jos North where there was a little hitch and the election could not be completed. He, however, said that he had yet to be briefed on the details of what transpired in the area. The publicity secretary commended the contestants for the high level of maturity they exhibited which, he said, reemphasised the fact that the elections were an internal party affair. He cited the example of Bokkos Local Government where candidates who lost the elections congratulated the winners and pledged to work together for the good of the party.
