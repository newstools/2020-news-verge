The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has commended the organised private sector and corporate bodies for their cash donations and other interventions as part of efforts to contain and stop further spread of Coronavirus in Nigeria.  The party’s National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, gave the commendation in a statement issuedon Friday in Abuja. He also commended health workers and other public safety functionaries for their sacrifices in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, in spite of obvious challenges. Ologbondiyan recalled that the party had called on the corporate bodies, the organised business community, research and medical institutions as well as public-spirited individuals to immediately come to the rescue of the country. “The party expresses happiness with the responses so far received from the private sector,” Ologbondiyan said. While urging the authorities to ensure judicious use of the resources, he called on other public-spirited organisations, groups and individuals to join in the collective efforts at curtailing the impacts of the deadly virus in the country. Ologbondiyan, however, urged Nigerians not to despair in the search for solution, while expressing hope that the country would “definitely overcome the present challenge with our brotherliness and collective resilient spirit, for which we are known all over the world. “The party, therefore, calls on all Nigerians not to be overcome by fear and anxiety. “We should remain heedful in following health safety directives, personal hygiene and social distancing as well as extending charity to one another, while also praying for divine intervention at this perilous time,” it said.
