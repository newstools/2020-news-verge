Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), has denied an online report indicating that it turned back a patient who tested positive for COVID-19.  LUTH, on its official twitter handle said; “although this story appears to be concocted, there is a need to put things in proper perspective. “LUTH is presently not a treatment centre for COVID-19. The protocol demands that all confirmed cases are referred to Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH), Yaba. “Long queue in LUTH waiting to be tested for Coronavirus is a figment of the imagination of the writer. There is no such thing happening in LUTH. “We therefore appealed to the general public to disregard the story. “We urge them to stay safe during this trying period and obey government directives on COVID-19 pandemic” it said.
