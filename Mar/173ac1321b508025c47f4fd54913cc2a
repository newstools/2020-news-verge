Pope Francis has cancelled a trip to Malta scheduled for May 31 due to the coronavirus crisis, the Vatican said on Monday.  “Due to the ongoing global situation and in agreement with the local authorities and church, (the visit) has been postponed to a date that is yet to be defined,” Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said. It was going to be the pontiff’s first foreign trip this year, and the fourth papal visit in 30 years to the strongly Catholic Mediterranean island.
