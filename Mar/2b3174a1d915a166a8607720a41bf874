Three aides to the Chief of Staff to the President, Mr Abba Kyari, have reportedly tested positive for coronavirus. Reports also indicate that other members of staff in Kyari’s office have been asked to self-isolate. The Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 is expected to brief the media on the status of Kyari, who reportedly tested positive for coronavirus on Monday. The panel is chaired by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustapha. “That is the agreement taken after discussions across several layers of government,” a source told The PUNCH. The task force members visited the Villa earlier on Tuesday and inspected the floor housing Kyari’s office.
