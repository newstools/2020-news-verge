Gov. Godwin Obaseki of Edo has gone into self isolation, following his close contact with the Bauchi State Governor, Sen. Bala Muhammed and Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari, who both tested positive for coronavirus.  In a statement on Wednesday in Benin, Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr Crusoe Osagie, said the governor had sent his samples for testing. Osagie said, “The governor has gone into self-isolation after the Governor of Bauchi State, Senator Bala Mohammed and Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari, tested positive for coronavirus. “The governor had met Senator Mohammed at the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) and National Economic Council (NEC) meetings. He also visited Mr. Kyari.” Osagie said although the governor was not showing any symptoms of the virus, “he has taken the necessary precaution to self-isolate to protect people that may otherwise come in contact with him.”
