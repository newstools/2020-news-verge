The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has called on organised bodies and corporate entities to partner other members of the international community for solutions to check the spread of Corona Virus (COVID-19) in the country.  The party in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, on Wednesday in Abuja also urged the groups to make effort towards provision of test kits, medications and facilities for the virus. “In the meantime, the PDP calls on the corporate bodies, the organized business community, international organizations, research and medical institutions and public-spirited individuals to immediately rally with other members of the international community for solutions to check the spread of COVID-19 in our country. “The party urged the groups to concert effort towards provision of test kits, medications and facilities while calling on Nigerians to intensify effort in observing directives on social distancing and personal hygiene to check further spread of the pandemic in the country.” The PDP, according to Ologbondiyan, also calls on President Muhammadu Buhari to engage other world leaders, international bodies and global health sector stakeholders for solution. He expressed concerns over public apprehension since the Chief of Staff to the President, Malam Abba Kyari, tested positive to the deadly COVID-19. He pleaded with President Buhari to take up the challenge of personally leading in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, like other leaders across the globe. Our correspondent reports that already the Federal Government has received the consignment of covid-19 tests and prevention kits donated by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba, to support efforts to contain the pandemic.
