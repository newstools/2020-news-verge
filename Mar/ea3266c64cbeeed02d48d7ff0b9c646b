The Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) says the reduction in the pump price of petrol from N145 to N125 by the Muhammadu Buhari administration showed that the country had a caring President.  BMO Chairman, Mr Niyi Akinsiju, in a statement in Abuja on Thursday, said that the reduction also showed the President’s commitment to utilise any opportunity to improve the lives of Nigerians Akinsiju, who said that the gains associated with the reduction in the fuel pump price were multi-faceted, said it would enable Nigerians to have more funds to spend on other needs. According to him, BMO sees the reduction as a way the administration is bonding with the people and further proves that it is peoples centered. “It has also shown that the Buhari administration has not failed to utilise any opportunity to improve the lives of Nigerians. “This aligns with one of the government’s cardinal objectives of bequeathing a healthy economy to the country. “Apart from enhancing the spending power of the citizens, the gains associated with the reduction in the fuel pump price are multi-faceted. “It will enable citizens to have more funds to spend on other needs thereby cushioning the effects of the downturn in the global economy as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic,” he said. According to BMO chairman, the reduction in pump price will enhance the productivity of the manufacturing sector as it would reduce the cost of operations. “Even the cost of transportation for ordinary Nigerians will fall as this is a natural trend in every economy and the result is improved life for all Nigerians. “Nigerians should appreciate and continue to support the government in its efforts to reposition the country. “We note that in spite of severe economic challenges confronting Nigeria, going by the drastic drop in global oil price, the Federal Government has remained focused on delivering on its obligations to the Nigerian people,’’ he said.
