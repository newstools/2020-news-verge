The coalition of civil society groups has condemned the way and manner in which the State House of Assembly under the embattled Speaker, Mudashiru Obasa, arrived at this decision to remove two of its principal officers and two other members, describing such as despicable, dictatorial and an exhibition of lawlessness, hence violating the position of the Supreme Court of Nigeria. The speaker had early last week, at the plenary, announced the sack of two principal officers – Chief Whip, Hon Rotimi Abiru and Deputy Majority Leader, Hon Olumuyiwa Jimoh as well as two other members – Hon Moshood Osun and Hon Kazeem Raheem Adekunle. They were accused of alleged gross misconduct, insubordination and actions capable of destabilizing the House. The coalition under the aegis of Lagos People’s Assembly gave this position on Sunday in Lagos at a press conference jointly addressed by Comrade Shina Loremikan of Campaign Against Impunity, Comrade Femi Lawson, Comrade Mogbojuri Kayode (Centre for Accountability), Comrade Funmi Jolade Ajayi (Community Women Initiatives), Comrade Olanike Akanji (Lagos Island Women Vanguard) and Olarinde Thomas (Yoruba Youth Assembly). Addressing newsmen at the International Press Centre, in Ogba area of the state, Comrade Loremikan, while expressing surprise about the way and manner Obasa arrived at his decision, said the coalition demanded an immediate recall of the suspended members and sacked principal officers.
