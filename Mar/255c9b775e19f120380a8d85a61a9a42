Delta Government on Monday reaffirmed its preparedness to contain any challenge that may be posed by the coronavirus pandemic in the state.  The state Commissioner for Health, Dr Mordi Ononye, gave the assurance in an interview with newsmen after inspecting facilities, including holding centre and isolation centre at the Specialist Hospital, Asaba. He said the inspection was part of measures to check the dreaded COVID-19. Ononye was in the company of the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Mr Chiedu Ebie and the Commissioner for Information, Mr Charles Aniagwu. He said the state government had established facilities across the state to effectively handle any contingency on the pandemic. He said the facilities included isolation centres built by the state government at the Federal Medical Center (FMC), Asaba, Specialist Hospital, Warri; Delta State University Teaching Hospital, Oghara and Specialist Hospital, Asaba. The commissioner noted that the government had also provided no fewer than 11 holding centres across the state. He said health professionals were currently undergoing special training to man the centres, adding that the state had also formed a strong partnership with the Federal Government, other state governments and the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) to combat the disease. Ononye appealed to the residents to remain calm. He urged the media not to cause panic but to report facts, adding that the state government was doing all that was necessary not to be overwhelmed. He advised that recent entrants into the country from any of the high-risk countries should self-quarantine themselves in the interest of public health. The commissioner said that the fight against coronavirus was a collective responsibility. He urged the people to maintain social distancing and improve on hygiene, adding that those exhibiting symptoms of the virus should report to hospitals.
