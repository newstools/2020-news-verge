Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State on Thursday advised the outgone Batch A 2019 National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members to be of good behavior.  He commended them for their hard work and proper display in the one-year mandatory service to their fatherland during their passing out parade in Lagos. Sanwo-Olu, represented by Dr Yusuf Jimoh, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Relations, said the corps members had contributed immensely to the state’s economy. “The scheme over the years contributed greatly to the growth and development of our country apart from fostering national unity and integration, it has provided corps members’ opportunities to contribute their own quota. “As you are going into a new phase of life, I urge you to put into use all the lessons and skills acquired including hard work, diligence and perseverance,’’ Sanwo-Olu said. The governor also said that the three outstanding corps members that distinguished themselves during the service year had done great for themselves. “As a government, we would continue to support the NYSC programme to promote the interest of our youths and in the interest of our national integration. “Our focus is to give our youths all necessary support to unleash their innovative and creative skills to become job creators. “We would continue to synergise with the NYSC on the SAED Programme to provide various platforms through which young graduates can acquire skills and access financial support to become successful entrepreneurs,’’ Sanwo-Olu said. Similarly, Mr Eddy Megwa, the State NYSC Coordinator, expressed gratitude to the state for its unflinching support. He said that no fewer 5,650 corps members in Lagos successfully finished their one-year mandatory service to their fatherland.
