The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) says it has not cancelled the results of the recently conducted Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME).  The board made this known in a statement signed by its Head of Media and Publicity, Dr Fabian Benjamin and made available to our reporter on Wednesday in Abuja. “JAMB has not cancelled the results of examinations conducted on Saturday, March 14, Monday, March 16 and Tuesday, March 17, 2020. “Therefore, candidates should disregard rumours making rounds that the results have been cancelled. “To check their results, candidates are to send ‘RESULT’ to 55019 and not on the board’s website. “The result of the first day was placed on the website and some fraudulent individuals were copying and manipulating it, in order to deceive unsuspecting candidates. “Hence our decision to move it to the mobile platform for candidates to use their unique phone numbers used in registering for the examination to access their results,” Benjamin said. He also said that results of over 450,000 candidates who sat for the examination on Tuesday would also be released on March 18. “Results of the examination will continue to be released as examinations are being taken. “In few days from now, we will be concluding the 2020 exercise. “We urge all candidates to be vigilant as many fraudsters who couldn’t operate successfully, given the security measures put in place to secure our system, will want to use every information gap to defraud or mislead unsuspecting candidates. “We urge the public to always fact check information provided on social media,” he said.
