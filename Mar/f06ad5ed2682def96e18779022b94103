Confirmed coronavirus cases in Spain jumped 14 per cent in the past 24 hours to Monday, with 480 additional deaths bringing the nation’s total to 33,000 cases and 2,200 deaths.  Of those deaths, around 1,200 have been recorded in the capital Madrid, which has now emerged as the epicentre of Spain’s outbreak. Figures from Spain’s Health Ministry offered a glimmer of hope amid the grim news: 3,300 patients have now recovered from the virus. “The number of daily recorded cases is also decreasing, but we are unsure whether we have hit the peak already. “These are decisive days,” the expert added, and predicted that Spain would reach the peak of its outbreak at some point during the coming week. “If the measures are applied well it is highly probable that a time will come soon when we begin to de-escalate. “That will be a key moment,” Fernando Simon, head of Spain’s Health Alert and Emergency Coordination Centre (CCAES) said. Spain is the second worst-hit European nation after Italy in the global coronavirus pandemic. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced on Sunday that the nationwide lockdown affecting the movements of just under 47 million citizens would have to be extended in order to gain control over the outbreak. Since March 15, authorities in the country have allowed people only to leave their houses in emergencies and to shop for food. The lockdown was originally set to last 15 days but will be extended until April 11, subject to a parliamentary vote this week.
