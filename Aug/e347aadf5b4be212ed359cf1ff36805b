Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar says the youth have a responsibility to guard against being infected by the Coronavirus, as well as help to stem the rate of infection.  Atuku, in a statement he issued in Abuja on Tuesday, ahead of the International Youth Day 2020, urged the youth to observe the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) protocols. International Youth Day is marked annually on Aug. 12, as an opportunity for governments and others to draw attention to youth issues worldwide “In this era of COVID-19 when the entire world is faced with this plague, the youth have a responsibility to guard against being infected, as well as help to stem the rate of infection by observing the NCDC protocols of washing/sanitizing hands, wearing of face mask, avoiding crowded areas and observing social distancing. “Indeed, the survival of humanity rests largely on the shoulders of the youths, as vigour is required to wear out this plague,” Atiku said. According to him, the vigour and spirit that the youth embody will play a crucial role in the socio-economic survival of the world and its rejuvenation, post-COVID-19. “As leaders of today, and tomorrow, I enjoin you all to preach and practice peace; demonstrate patriotism at all levels; rid yourselves of nepotism and promote competence above all forms of sentiments. “Only then can we truly have the Nigeria of our dream,” he said. Atiku felicitated with the youth across the globe on the 20th Anniversary of the International Youth Day celebration. He saluted the Nigerian youth in particular for their commitment and perseverance toward the attainment of a greater Nigeria. The former VP said that the theme of year 2020 celebration “Youth Engagement for Global Action” gave a critical picture of what the world perceived about the stake of young people globally. He pledged to continue to offer his shoulders for all youth to climb “because as youths, you are leaders of today”.
