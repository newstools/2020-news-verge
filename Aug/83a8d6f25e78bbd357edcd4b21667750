Emirates is set to restart passenger services to Conakry, Guinea and Dakar, Senegal from 3rd September, with a linked service operating two times a week while utilizing the Emirates Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. This brings the total number of cities served by Emirates in Africa to eight. Emirates is gradually and responsibly restoring its network connectivity, providing customers with more travel options to Dubai and beyond. The addition of linked services between Conakry and Dakar will boost Emirates’ growing network to 77 cities, providing travellers enhanced global connectivity, particularly to and from destinations in the Middle East, West Asia, Europe, the Americas and the Far East, with one convenient stop in Dubai. Customers can stop over or travel to Dubai as the city has re-opened for international business and leisure visitors. COVID-19 PCR tests are mandatory for all inbound and transit passengers arriving to Dubai and the UAE, including UAE citizens, residents and tourists, irrespective of the country they are coming from. Dubai is one of the most popular global destinations. From sun-soaked beaches and heritage activities to world class hospitality and leisure facilities, Dubai has proved its worth. In 2019, the city welcomed 16.7 million visitors and hosted over hundreds of global meetings and exhibitions, as well as sports and entertainment events. Dubai was one of the world’s first cities to obtain Safe Travels stamp from the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) – which endorses Dubai’s comprehensive and effective measures to ensure guest health and safety. Customers can now travel with confidence, as Emirates has committed to cover COVID-19 related medical expenses, free of cost, should they be diagnosed with COVID-19 during their travel while they are away from home.
