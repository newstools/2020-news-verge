The All Progressives Congress (APC) has called on opposition political parties to support the independence of the judiciary, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), security services and other critical state institutions.  APC’s Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Mr Yekini Nabena, said in a statement in Abuja on Tuesday that this was necessary to ensure hitch-free governorship poll in Edo on September 19. Nabena urged the opposition parties to emulate President Muhammadu Buhari, who ensured free and fair elections in the opposition states in the 2019 general elections. He said “President Muhammadu Buhari’s declaration that the All Progressives Congress (APC) could have used the military and other security services to overrun opposition states in the 2019 general election but chose free, fair elections, is a solid pointer that in the current administration, the days of stolen and procured electoral mandates are fast fading. “Critical state institutions such as the judiciary, INEC and security services have been the ultimate beneficiaries of the president’s impartiality and non-interference.’’
