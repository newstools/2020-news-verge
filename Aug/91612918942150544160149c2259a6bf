The world of DJ Sunny Yankee and Cybersound music company, revolves around two studios, one based in Sydney, Australia and the other in Lagos, Nigeria. However, the duo have decided to create a collaboration album between upcoming artistes in Nigeria and in Australia. According to the CEO of Cybersound, DJ Sunny Yankee, the album Dream Matters came about as an avenue to allow young upcoming stars express and announce themselves to the world. The genre of the album is very diverse, as we have gospel, afropop, pop, R&B and African fusion. The album has 12 tracks and will be available on various platforms for streaming and downloads. Artistes featured on this project include; DJ Sunnyyankee and Cybersound, Saint, Sinmi Jay, Boluwatife, Stanleyton and Black Athena. Listening through the album, you are sure to be infected by the groove, on tracks such as “Turn Up”, the praise infused “Kajormayin Jesu” and the beautifully crafted “Show Them”.
