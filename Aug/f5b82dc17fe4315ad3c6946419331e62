Mr Adebayo Hassan, Secretary, National Union of Petroleum and National Gas Workers (NUPENG) Sango-Ota Chapter, has appealed to the Lagos State Government {LASG} to urgently intervene in the strike by the Petroleum Tanker Drivers that started on Monday.  Hassan made the appeal on Monday in an interview with our reporter in Ota, Ogun. It was reported that the Petroleum Tanker Drivers in Lagos State on Monday withdrew their services as directed by the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG). The state Chairman, NUPENG, Mr Tayo Aboyeji, confirmed the development to NAN on Monday in Lagos. Hassan said that the appeal became necessary because the lives of their members were more important than work. “We are appealing to the Lagos State Government to quickly intervene and put everything under control,” he said. He alleged that some of the security officials deployed in Apapa had been a major problem to the union’s drivers. Hassan said that the security officials were not always coming to the aid of their members whenever they were attacked by hoodlums. “These security personnel used to maltreat our drivers when they refused to yield to their demands. “It takes our drivers between a week and two to load at the Apapa depot because of the bottlenecks created by the security officials,” he said. Hassan also alleged that that the activities of the security personnel were part of the causes of the gridlocks usually experienced by drivers at Apapa and its environs. Hassan urged the public not to panic, assuring them that the strike would be addressed and be resolved by the appropriate authorities.
