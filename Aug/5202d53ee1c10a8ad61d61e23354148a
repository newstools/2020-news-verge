The Ebullient Youths for Good Governance (EYGG), an Enugu State-based political organisation, has described the seamless and rancour-free congress of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in the state as laudable.  Founder of the group, Mr Victor Uchedienyi, gave the commendation in a statement, on Monday in Enugu. Uchedienyi said the peaceful conduct of the congress was a clear evidence that the party faithful and gladiators regarded the unity of the party as paramount and above personal interests. He said that those who expected the competitive nature of the congress to breed acrimony among the various interests, were disappointed. The founder said that the PDP members had high expectations that the new executive members of the party would leverage on the successes recorded in the last four years to break new grounds. He commended Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi for providing the party executive with the enabling environment to discharge their duties. “We appreciate the leadership style of Ugwuanyi, which we believe provided the leadership of the party with the enabling ground to perform. “The peace, unity and progress that radiates in the party will not have been possible without the governor,” he said. Uchedienyi charged the new leadership of the party to run an all-inclusive administration, adding that anything short of that would be counterproductive. “We have implicit confidence in the ability of the party chairman, Mr Augustine Nnamani, and we call on all party faithful to accord him the support to succeed,” he said. Uchedienyi urged the new leadership of the party to take such actions that would guarantee the growth of the party in the state. “We pray God to give them the wisdom to take the party to greater heights and ensure that the right persona are brought into power to serve the people,” he said. Recall that the PDP in Enugu State, on Aug. 8, 2020, conducted its state congress during which the Nnamani led executive was returned to serve for another four years.
