Mrs Elsie Ilori, Head, Surveillance and Epidemiology Department, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), on Monday advised health workers to maintain high index of suspicion on any patient as international flights are set to resume.  Ilori gave the advice at the briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 on Abuja. She said that high index of suspicion for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases would facilitate response. She said that NCDC would intensify training of frontline responders on effective the implementation of Infection Prevention Control (IPC) measures for the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). Ilori said that the training would help to limit exposure to COVID-19 and other diseases. She urged that all states should have a trial station at every health facility to determine the priority need and proper placement and treatment of every patient. This, she said, was important for case management and appropriate channelling of human and material resources. “Our ability as health professionals to maintain high index of suspicion for COVID-19 or any other infectious disease will go a long way to enhance response. ”It will also ensure that there is no further transmission of the virus to health workers or others,” she said.
