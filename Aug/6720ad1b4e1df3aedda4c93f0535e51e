Speaker of the Kogi House of Assembly, Matthew Kolawole has called on opposition parties in the state to drop their grievances and join hands with Gov. Yahaya Bello to move the State forward.  Kolawole made the call in a statement Signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Femi Olugbemi, and made available to newsmen on Monday in Lokoja. The speaker was reacting to the Supreme Court judgment, dismissing the appeal by the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP) Musa Wada, challenging the Appeal Court judgment affirming election of Gov. Bello. Kolawole said the dismissal of the petitions filed by Wada and Natasha Akpoti of Social Democratic Party (SDP) respectively was long envisaged as many of the points canvassed by the petitioners were based on hearsay. He stressed that the Justices of the Supreme Court had done justice in upholding the decision of the lower courts on the issues and described the judgement as heartwarming, cheering and a landmark. The Speaker said that the judiciary had once again, proven to be the last hope of the people adding that the judgment had confirmed the popularity of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in the state. “I urge the opposition to drop whatever grievances they might have and join hands with Governor Yahaya Bello to move the State to the next level of development. “This is against the backdrop that the election held on the Nov. 16, 2019, was squarely won by the All Progressive Congress (APC) and Gov. Bello overwhelmingly”, said. The speaker said the legislature under his watch would continue to collaborate with the Executive and other stakeholders to make laws for the Bello-led administration to do more for the people of the State.
