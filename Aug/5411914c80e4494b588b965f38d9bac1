Gov Godwin Obaseki, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for the Sept. 19 governorship election in Edo, said on Tuesday that the party would give power sector priority if re-elected.  Obaseki said this when he visited to Ewohimi community, Esan South East Local Government Area of the state, in continuation of his ward to ward campaign tour. He noted that the major challenge observed since the beginning of the tour was shortage of power supply in all the areas he visited. The governor, however, said his administration had in 2019 constructed the Ossiomo Power Plant, cosidering the electricity challenge being faced by the people. He said that the Ossiomo power plant was currently generating 50 megawatts of electricity to the state. Earlier, Chief Dan Orbih, the Chairman of the PDP campaign council in the state, said that the Edo election was vital because it would be a test for the sustenance of democracy in the country. He noted that democracy was about the people, adding that the governor and candidate of the party was committed to repositioning the state and moving it forward. The state Chairman of the party, Dr Tony Aziegbemi, announced that hundreds of persons from the opposition All Progressive Congress (APC) had defected to the party.
