The All Progressives Congress (APC) has extolled the virtues of its former National Chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, who will celebrate his 81st birthday on Aug. 12.  APC Deputy National Publicity Secretary Yekini Nabena, said this in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja. According to Nabena, APC rejoices with Chief Odigie-Oyegun, his family, friends and associates for the good health, exemplary life and good tidings the Almighty God has granted him. He said that Odigie-Oyegun was undoubtedly a man of many achievements because he was the country’s youngest permanent secretary and first elected governor of Edo State. “He was the first National Chairman of the APC, who led us as then opposition party to presidential victory in 2015 after defeating the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). “Indeed, there is much to celebrate as Odigie-Oyegun clocks another year in an illustrious life journey.” He said that the APC Caretaker Committee, led by Gov. Mai Mala Buni of Yobe, would continue to count on the support of Odigie-Oyegun and other party leaders to achieve its goal of repositioning the party and ensure peace and unity across the party ranks. He prayed for Odigie-Oyegun’s long, healthy and fulfilled years in service to the party and country.
